    "let's take the sentence \"hello, what's up?\" and walk through how the LLaMA model, which uses transformers, processes it step by step. Imagine we're training a super-smart robot to understand and reply to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step-by-Step Processing in LLaMA\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input Sentence\n",
    "You say: \"hello, what's up?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tokenization\n",
    "What it does: Break down the sentence into smaller parts called tokens.\n",
    "Example: The sentence becomes [\"hello\", \",\", \"what\", \"'s\", \"up\", \"?\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Embedding Layer\n",
    "What it does: Turns each token into a numerical code that the robot can understand.\n",
    "Example: Each word gets converted into a list of numbers (vectors).\n",
    "\"hello\" → [0.5, 0.2, ...]\n",
    "\",\" → [0.1, 0.4, ...]\n",
    "\"what\" → [0.7, 0.3, ...]\n",
    "\"'s\" → [0.6, 0.1, ...]\n",
    "\"up\" → [0.9, 0.8, ...]\n",
    "\"?\" → [0.2, 0.5, ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Positional Encoding\n",
    "What it does: Adds information about the order of words in the sentence.\n",
    "Example: It helps the robot understand that \"hello\" is the first word and \"?\" is the last.\n",
    "\"hello\" (position 1) → [0.5, 0.2, ...] + [position 1 encoding]\n",
    "\",\" (position 2) → [0.1, 0.4, ...] + [position 2 encoding]\n",
    "And so on for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Self-Attention\n",
    "What it does: Helps the robot focus on important words in the sentence.\n",
    "Example: When processing \"what's,\" it looks at \"hello\" and \"up\" to understand the context.\n",
    "\"hello\" pays attention to all words (but mostly to itself).\n",
    "\"what's\" pays a lot of attention to \"hello\" and \"up\" to understand the question.\n",
    "\"up\" pays attention to \"hello\" and \"what's\" to understand the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "What it does: Looks at the sentence from different perspectives.\n",
    "Example: Multiple attention heads focus on different aspects:\n",
    "One head might focus on punctuation.\n",
    "Another head might focus on the words \"hello\" and \"what's.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Feed-Forward Neural Network\n",
    "What it does: Processes and refines the information.\n",
    "Example: After focusing on important words, the robot processes this information to better understand the sentence.\n",
    "The neural network helps make sense of the attention results and prepares a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Normalization and Residual Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual Connections: \n",
    "These are like shortcut paths that help the robot keep the important information from previous layers while adding new details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization:\n",
    "This keeps the information balanced and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Generating a Response\n",
    "What it does: After understanding the input, the robot generates a reply.\n",
    "Example: It decides to reply to \"hello, what's up?\" with \"Hi there! How can I help you today?\""
