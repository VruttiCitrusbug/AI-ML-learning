Some are given away free, some are  £5, some more, it really depends on the package you buy (for example: 100mins, 5gb). In the UK you shouldn\\'t need any proof of address or any ID to buy a top-up (PAYG = Pay As You GO) sim. Only need ID for a contract sim (pay monthly).\\nThis should be similar in EU countries but we cannot say this as a fact.

The request for triple rooms is therefore something that comes up frequently.

The FAQs indicated that the itineary would be sent 2-3 weeks before the tour begins. I sent an enquiry to Expat Explore a few days ago regarding when they will send the itinerary with the confirmation & information. The Expat operator was very nice and replied quickly. She indicated that the itinerary will be sent 3-5 days prior to the tour leaving. I am a bit concerned as my flight to Rome is booked on March 23rd and I made a reservation at the BV Oly Hotel in Rome for March 24 & 25th.  According to the website the tour was to leave at the BV Oly and return there.  I asked the operator if the bus was still leaving from BV Oly Hotel. She indicated at this point the bus will be leaving from the Hotel Excel Roma Montemario at 7:30 am. Kindly note that could change.  Is there any way that the itinerary can be sent to me by March 16 or no later than March 20th.  It is very difficult to make hotel reservations and arrange for transportation from the airport especially if the details are still not finalized.

Due to this, we understand that our travelers bring with them certain expectations of the tour.\\n\\nWe have agreements in place with our supplies that the standard accommodation provided would be twin-share, and therefore this is communicated upon booking. \\n\\nIn a case such as yours, Expat Explore arranged for a family room for yourself and your family where possible and as this was not agreed upon in our contracts with our suppliers, the addition was at the expense of Expat Explore.\\n\\nWe hope that despite your dissatisfaction with our standard twin-share accommodation you still had a wonderful time on your tour and will continue to explore the world with Expat Explore as your preferred partner to Make Travel Possible. \\n\\nKind Regards\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Nicole,\\n\\nThanks for the response.\\n\\nIn every one of the hotels we went there were family rooms that were available. However they were handed to single/individual travelers. We had brought this to our travel leader (Michelle\\'s) notice several times. In some occasions we were allotted a proper room but in most other occasions we 3 had to adjust in a small room or I had to stay with another individual. Again, we had made our request from get go reg our need and if those rooms were available why werent they allocated to us? We have proofs of other individuals getting much larger rooms than us and also proofs of hotel managers sharing that they were asked for a bigger family room for us.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Ravishankar,\\n\\nI hope this message finds you well.\\n\\n As we discussed previously, I wanted to reiterate that Expat Explore Travel does not offer family or triple rooms as a standard service for our tours. This is clearly stated when booking your tour, and we do not guarantee the availability of triple rooms.\\n\\nSingle travelers who are provided with rooms have purchased a single supplement room upgrade at an additional cost prior to the tour commencing. These arrangements are made prior to the start of the tour.\\n\\nWe understand that your situation required special accommodations due to your family\\'s needs. We did try our best to accommodate your family, even arranging last minute accommodations when necessary. Unfortunately, some locations do not have family rooms available or those rooms have already been booked by other guests.\\n\\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and we appreciate your understanding. \\n\\nPlease let us know if there is anything else we can do to assist you.\\n\\nKind Regards\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Nicole, \\n\\nThe single travelers have since the tour become good friends and they shared that they never paid for any upgrade. My simple question is this- having known that our family has a need for a family room why didnt the tour leader provide us the requested room and instead gave to single travelers who would have otherwise happily stayed at the given room.\\n\\nYou cannot keep citing policies that are not clear as the reason we were not given the convenient rooms. While the tour is over and there isnt much I can do execept for sharing my grievance online I do expect a little more openness to accept the fact that its poor planning.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Ravishankar, \\n\\nWe apologize for the long response time, we take all critical reviews very seriously and have to follow up with our operations team and tour leaders and this takes time especially during the European Summer season.\\n\\nWe take great pride in Making Travel Possible and ensuring travelers leave with only the best memories - which will last a lifetime. To do this, we endeavor to hire only the very best tour leaders, as they are such a massive part of this adventure. \\n\\nAfter investigating your concerns with our Operations Team, we have determined that the reason some travelers received a single room was due to an uneven number of single travelers. In order to ensure fairness and equality, we implemented a rotation system where the single room was allocated to different single travelers at different destinations throughout the tour.\\n\\nWe are hopeful that you still had a wonderful time exploring Europe.\\n\\nBest Regards\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Thanks Nicole!\\n\\nThis still doesnt answer my question of why the receptionists across different cities shared the same feedback that they were never requested a family room/bigger room.\\n\\nWont it make sense to have allotted our twin room to the 2 single travelers and we given the bigger rooms that were allotted to single travelers.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Ravi, \\n\\nWe understand that you may have some remaining concerns, and we want to ensure that we address them to the best of our abilities. While we are more than happy to assist you via email, we believe that a phone call might be more effective in providing you with the necessary clarity and resolving any outstanding issues.\\n\\nPlease let us know if you would prefer a phone call and provide us with a suitable time to reach out to you. We will do our best to accommodate your schedule and ensure that all your concerns are properly addressed.\\n\\nKind Regards\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Sure Nicole. Iam available to chat between 7 am - 12 pm PST anyday.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Ravishankar,\\n\\nPlease note that we have attempted to contact you telephonically to no avail.\\n\\nWe apologize for any confusion or miscommunication regarding the room allocations. Please understand that Expat Explore does not typically offer triple or family rooms as part of our tour accommodations. Therefore, such requests were not made during the booking process.\\n\\nThe availability of family rooms in Amsterdam and Switzerland was due to our last minute negotiations with the hotels, ensuring a more comfortable stay for yourself and your family without incurring exorbitant charges (as triple rooms are charged at double the standard rate).\\n\\nIt is important to note that rooming lists are sent to the hotels 30 days prior to departure, and the hotels themselves allocate the rooms to the travelers. While our tour leader is unable to remove a traveler from their assigned room, if a traveler voluntarily agrees to switch to a smaller room and both parties agreed, arrangements could be made.\\n\\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding regarding our room allocation procedures.\\n\\nIf you have any further concerns or questions, please let us know, and we\\'ll be glad to assist you. \\n\\nWarmest Regards\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Nicole,\\n\\nI regret missing your call but I did not receive any calls during the time prescribed.\\n\\nCan you pl call me on July 5th anytime between 8 am PST - 1 PM PST?\\n\\nElse, pl share your number.\\n\\nThanks,\\nRavi\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Ravishankar,\\n\\nWe appreciate your patience as we thoroughly investigated the matter at hand.\\n\\nAfter engaging in multiple discussions, we discovered that your tour leader had requested a double or family room at each location. The decision to grant a family room at the Excel Roma Montemario was made as a gesture of goodwill. Michelle did indeed make a private request for this accommodation. However, please understand that at the time of her request, the hotel was unable to make the necessary arrangements and once you asked as well, was this only granted by the hotel.\\n\\nRegarding the situation where you were placed on a different floor from your family, this was purely for administrative purposes and for the sake of maintaining accurate paperwork and lists. Michelle was made aware beforehand that you would not be sharing a room with another traveler and would be sharing the twin room with your family instead.\\n\\nWe sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and we hope that we have addressed all of your concerns.\\n\\nThank you once again for your understanding.\\n\\nKind Regards\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Nicole,\\n\\nThis is redundant information. You had already made it clear after conversing with our tour leader this information. Did you try calling the hotels and validating the information?\\n\\nThe decision to grant a family room at Excel Roma was made on my repeated insistence and not my tour leader\\'s request to the receptionist. If I could get a family room after sensing its availability why wasnt my tour leader able to get it when she was helping us check in?\\n\\nAdditionally, as mentioned during the call there were 4 other hotels - Paris, Munich, Venice, Rhine valley where I got confirmation from the receptionist the next morning that a family room was indeed available. I ended up being un-necesarrily respectful of the tour leader thinking that she would be representing our fair ask.\\n\\nPl call me after 3 PST tomorrow, lets discuss this further as I have started to believe that this feedback of mine is being taken lightly.\\n\\nThanks,\\nRavi\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Thanks Nadine! Still awaiting response from Nicole and team.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Ravishankar,\\n\\nWe are very disappointed to hear that you feel your feedback is being taken lightly, we can assure you that we have thoroughly investigated your concerns. As a company, we are passionate about making travel possible and delivering what we promise, and in this case, we have provided all the services outlined in our tour package.\\n\\nAs previously stated, Expat Explore Travel does not offer triple rooms and the hotels we contract provide us with twin-share accommodation only. In the rare instances when a hotel may decide to provide a triple room to our guests (either at guest or tour leader request), it is entirely at their discretion and this should not be seen as a shortcoming on the part of Expat Explore Travel. We do not offer and therefore cannot guarantee family rooms on our tours. We want to clarify again that all our tour packages include twin-share accommodation only, and in any instances where a hotel provides a triple/family room is an exception.\\n\\nThe well-being of our guests is our number one priority. I sincerely hope that your experience beyond the accommodation was truly enriching, and that you and your family created cherished memories that will last a lifetime.\\n\\nWe look forward to the possibility of welcoming you on another journey with Expat Explore in the future.

How do I find out when we will be arriving at our hotels\\n\\nThank you\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Cynthia, \\n\\nThanks for getting in touch with us. \\n\\nFor shorter itineraries most travellers are able to pack enough clothes to last them for the duration of the trip. For longer tours, you may need to plan for doing your laundry during the tour. Your tour leader will be able to recommend the best place for this.\\n\\nHotel laundry services are less common in Europe and can be very expensive, so the tour leader’s recommendation will most likely be a local laundromat in a destination where you have at least a two-night stay. In bigger cities you may be able to use a laundry service, who will pick up from the hotel and then deliver the clean clothes back to reception. These services are operated by third-parties so your tour leader and Expat Explore will not be responsible for any issues - try not to bring any clothes with you that are valuable or sentimental in case of loss or damage.\\n\\nAlternatively, you could wash your clothes in the sink/wash basin in your hotel room, particularly if it\\'s smaller items like socks and underwear. If you do, take care not to be too obvious when you hang them up to dry as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms. We suggest doing this in destinations where you spend two or more nights so the clothes have as much time to dry as possible.\\n______________________________________________________\\n\\nYou will receive a detailed tour program with your Tour Leader Announcement email at 5 days prior to your departure, please keep an eye out for this email.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.\\n\\nWe look forward to hosting you!\\n\\nKind Regards,\\nHannah Rhoode\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"can I bring a purse and a small back pack on the coach.  havent received anything directly from the tour person, and we still do not know what hotel will be starting point, when will that be available.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Cynthia, \\n\\nThanks for getting in touch with us. \\n\\nKindly check your email, your tour leader announcement was sent out today.

For some reason I thought I was already charged each time for the amendments, which we tried very hard to make sure we could still book this trip. Hence the changes. I do appreciate the clarification but why I say it’s bad business is because we are literally entering a recession. I can imagine at some point you all will be affected by this and I can only hope that you or your colleagues aren’t impacted by it. I’m frankly tired, as many people are, of huge business having policies that would take your deposit and charge you additional for canceling a trip well in advance. You can absolutely charge my card. But truly, don’t forget this interaction once you guys feel the impact of the economies slowing down because you absolutely will wherever you are located. Everyone will feel it. I’m sure you all felt it a bit at the beginning of the pandemic. Big business don’t care and they’re out to make a profit no matter what and people are waking up to this.

Please be sure to note all medical conditions and requirements on your Important Passenger Information forms. \\n______________________________________________________\\n\\nFor shorter itineraries most travellers are able to pack enough clothes to last them for the duration of the trip. For longer tours, you may need to plan for doing your laundry during the tour. Your tour leader will be able to recommend the best place for this.\\n\\nHotel laundry services are less common in Europe and can be very expensive, so the tour leader’s recommendation will most likely be a local laundromat in a destination where you have at least a two-night stay. In bigger cities you may be able to use a laundry service, who will pick up from the hotel and then deliver the clean clothes back to reception. These services are operated by third-parties so your tour leader and Expat Explore will not be responsible for any issues - try not to bring any clothes with you that are valuable or sentimental in case of loss or damage.\\n________________________________________________________\\n\\nIt is impossible to say exactly what you will need during your tour. Please refer to the tour itinerary for full details of what activities are included, which meals are included and what is excluded.\\n\\nWe would recommend budgeting €25-€40 per day (this excludes optional excursions) and this will vary depending on how much you wish to spend on snacks, drinks, souvenirs, optional excursions etc.\\n\\nMost facilities will accept credit/debit cards, however we do not recommend that you solely rely on cards as there will be times when a computer is down, the machine has run out of money or some other problem arises and cash is not available! It is therefore advisable to always have a small amount of cash-on-hand for emergencies.\\n\\nIt is usually possible to exchange money into the local currency after arriving in the country - your tour leader will be happy to assist you when arriving in a country that requires a new currency, but the easiest way is to make a withdrawal from a local cash machine. By withdrawing from an ATM you will also usually get a much better exchange rate than at a foreign exchange shop/kiosk.\\n\\nI hope this information gives you some clarity and if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out. \\n\\nBest regards \\nHannah R \\nExpat Explore Team\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hello, \\nCan I get a list of hotels that we will be staying at for this tour?

Okay, so the reason I ask is that I want to guarantee that my boys, Ryan & Aiden, and I will be all set when it comes to making this trip.  I am financially all set for this as I\\'ve been planning on it for years, but I do not want to run into any obstacles if the rest of my party is unable to meet the necessary payments, etc. which is why I wanted to separate my booking.  So, I\\'m not sure what options I have at this moment and appreciate any guidance you could offer.  Additionally, thank you for the info on the room pairings...I thought that my boys and I could simply share one room...I didn\\'t realize that wasn\\'t an option.  Is there a potential way to solve this particular problem?  Thank you, again, for taking the time to help me.\\n\\nAl Luzi\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Albert,\\n\\nThank you so much for your message.\\n\\nAs it stands, you should not worry regarding payments because as long as you are the lead traveler, you will have control over the booking. This means that if you have any travelers within the group who are not able to make the payment on the due date, you can request to have their seats cancelled at the loss of their deposit. Your seats are ensured as long as you make payments for your and your sons\\' seats.\\n\\nFor rooming, since we cannot accommodate 3 pax in 1 room and both your sons are under 18, one needs to be paired with another adult from your group while the other 1 is paired with you.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.\\n\\nYours in Travel and Adventure,\\nJerome G\\nExpat Explore Team\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Okay, thank you.  Question for you then, if it ends up being literally me along with my two sons, is there a way that you could accommodate the three of us together either on this booked tour or another European tour through Expat Travel?  Thank you again for helping me with all of this.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Albert,\\n\\nThank you for your messages.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we would not be able to since both your sons are minors (under 18) so they need to each be paired with an Adult within the group and we do not have triple rooms for our packages, this is the same for all our Tours.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.\\n\\nYours in Travel and Adventure,\\nJerome G\\nExpat Explore Team\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"So, forgive me for being redundant here, but if my girlfriend and her children do not go, I\\'m essentially stuck...correct?  As I\\'m trying to piece together a plan to still make this trip happen, what is your cancellation policy at this point?  My understanding is that if I cancel this booked tour, I lose the 1716.00 deposit in it\\'s entirety with no further obligations beyond that...is that right?  Or a partial cancellation would result in each individual\\'s deposit being forfeited?  \\n\\nThank you again for your time.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Albert,\\n\\nYes, if you and your 2 minor sons will be the only ones remaining for this booking, then we cannot push through due to the rule that minors need to each be paired with an adult within your group. Also, cancelling the booking at this point will result to the loss of deposit as we only have a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee. This is discussed in section B4 of our Terms and Conditions. https://expatexplore.com/terms-conditions/\\n\\nHowever, I wanted to present an alternate solution for you. We do offer unlimited tour or tour date changes to our travelers, and as long as the tour or tour date change is requested at least 76 Days or more from the start date, then it will not result to any amendment fees.\\n\\nSo if your travel companions cannot travel then instead if cancelling, we can change the tour or tour date to a more suitable date for everyone. Or in the event that it will only be the 3 of you left due to cancellations, then maybe we can change the tour to a more later date since 1 of your sons will be 18 this November.

Thanks\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Yuli, \\n\\nThank you for getting in touch with us, \\n\\nRegrettably, we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive.

This will ensure that you have your own bedroom and private bathroom for the entire tour.\\n\\nAt the end of your tour you will have the opportunity to thank your Expat Explore tour leader and driver by offering them a tip. We suggest somewhere between €5-€7 per person per day. Tipping is entirely voluntary and the above rate is offered as a suggested guide only.\\n\\nAll optional excursions are bookable on tour in cash (Euro), directly with your tour leader.

This provides us with a never-before-experienced dilemma of having a limited number of single rooms we can offer on any given tour. \\n\\nAs mentioned, the single rooms are thus subject to availability and sold on a first-come-first-served basis. With this in mind, I regret to have to inform you that after some discussion with our operations team, there are no longer single rooms available on your tour.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"So there are no single rooms?

Carolyn\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Carolyn, \\n\\nI apologize for any confusion. \\n\\nAs mentioned during the quoting process, rooms are subject to availability.\\n\\nTypically, our rooming lists are sent to hotels around 30 days before the tour departure. While our operations team sometimes manages to secure single rooms closer to the departure date, unfortunately, in this instance, the hotels no longer have the necessary availability.\\n\\nThis means that you\\'ll be sharing a room with a fellow traveler of the same gender during the tour, as the option for a single room is currently not feasible. \\n\\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Well that\\'s unfortunate.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi,\\nI’m planning to book my flights over next week.

We also want to ensure that you explore as much as possible, which may require long periods without stops on the coach as we drive to new destination.\\n\\nWe offer walking tours in most cities (up to 3 hours), and a wheelchair is not always a practical option as there are often cobbled streets and stairs on these tours.\\n\\nFor travellers in wheelchairs, you will only be able to store your wheelchair under the coach with the other luggage. Thus, on the long drives between cities you will not necessarily have access to your wheelchair if we make a quick bathroom stop along the way. Please note that travelling with a wheelchair could prove difficult as our coaches don\\'t have wheelchair lifts, as such you will need to be able to board and alight the coach on your own.\\n\\nWith regards to our accommodation, not all hotels have lifts and this can potentially mean having to carry bags up and down stairs.\\n\\nPlease advise if you would like to proceed with this booking, with the above being noted?\\n\\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\\n\\nKind Regards\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Dhiren,\\nCan we atleast use a walker to speed our walking capabilities?\\nVerona Datu Manalili and Rosita Imbat we both have walker handcarry that we can bring inside the coach if seat in the back.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"I have four more ladies friends who are very interested to joined me if possible we will confirm tomorrow.

This is similar to that of airlines - to encourage early booking. This means that the very first seats sold on the coach are the cheapest and then the seats increase in price increments as the coach sells out. This means the last seats booked on the coach are more expensive than the first. This also leads to the seat prices being different, depending on the time you booked and why some departures are cheaper than others.\\n\\nPlease note that direct bookings were made prior to your request, which is why the price is currently 2405.00 USD. \\n\\nPlease advise if you would like to proceed with this booking?\\n\\nWe look forward to hearing from you\\n\\nKind Regards\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Nicole E\\nI paid the deposits already of $214.50 on August 14, 2023 and $160.87 every two weeks after Giovanna put a hold on the price then you raised  after I purchased the Europe escape 12days package you should honored the price I saw on the Tour adventures on  TourRadar.

This is similar to that of airlines - to encourage early booking. This means that the very first seats sold on the coach are the cheapest and then the seats increase in price increments as the coach sells out. This means the last seats booked on the coach are more expensive than the first. This also leads to the seat prices being different, depending on the time you booked and why some departures are cheaper than others.\\n\\nPlease note that direct bookings were made prior to your request, which is why the price is currently 2405.00 USD.\\n\\nUpon calling Tour Radar on 22 August 2023, you spoke to Anita and indicated you were accepting the amount of 2405.00 USD, thereby confirming your booking.\\n\\nKind Regards\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Verona,\\n\\nI would like to share that I have gone ahead and responded to your email and provided you with the information that you requested regarding the Meet Up Location for your Tour.\\n\\nI also added the link to your Passenger Information Page (I updated the info that you provided) and instructions on filling out the rest of the lacking information.\\n\\nIf you need any more help, please do not hesitate to respond through this conversation.  \\n \\nYours in Travel and Adventure,\\nJerome Gilos \\nTraveller Onboarding Coordinator\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Verona,\\n\\nGood Day!\\n\\nI would like to ask for your assistance in completing your Passenger Information Page through this link. https://expatexplore.com/cs_contact/login?c=12325&amp;b=202324175\\n\\nYou can also update the information about your Insurance on that page. \\n\\nLastly, I will reach out to Rose for her to update her page as well.\\n\\nYours in Travel and Adventure,\\nJerome Gilos\\nTraveller Onboarding Coordinator\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Jerome I have completed my requirements and I am insured with AXA INSURANCE \\n\\nVeronamanalili63@gmail.com \\nVerona Datu Manalili \\n209 775 1002\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Verona, \\n\\nThank you for your message, \\n\\nPlease complete the travel insurance section and sign the Passenger Indemnity form located at the bottom of the Important Passenger form.\\n\\nhttps://expatexplore.com/cs_contact/travel-details?c=12325&amp;b=202324175 \\n\\nIf you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Verona,\\n\\nThank you for reaching out!\\n\\nThe Final Tour Documents are emailed to customers 3-5 Days before their tour starts.

When on tour, ensure you keep personal belongings on you at all times and that your suitcase/backpack has a lock on it, especially in tourist areas. It may be advisable to wear a money belt to store money, credit cards and passport.\\n\\n\\nI hope this information gives you some clarity and if there\\'s anything else you need assistance with, please feel free to reach out. \\n\\nBest regards \\nHannah R \\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Regarding the travel insurance. During the booking of the trip there was an option to waive the travel insurance.  I am confused as to why NOW, you are stating that it is mandatory.\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi James,\\n\\nWe highly recommend obtaining comprehensive travel insurance, ensuring you won\\'t need to worry about emergencies that can happen anytime, anywhere, before or during your travels. \\n\\nInsurance can cover the cost of your airfare, as well as your adventufre(s) in the case of an unforeseen cancellation. It ensures that you do not have to worry about any unplanned changes to your travel plans, such as having to rush home to an ill family member or having an adventure changed or cancelled because of a natural disaster. It can even help with smaller things - like lost luggage or stolen cameras.\\n\\nWhen selecting a travel insurance policy we recommend a minimum coverage of USD 200,000 for repatriation and emergency rescue. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, medical, cancellation, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects.\\n\\nBefore you book your adventure, you\\'re welcome to obtain a quote with TourRadar\\'s insurance partner, XCover, and check out the policy details by clicking into the date you\\'re looking to travel from the adventure details page. You\\'ll see the Insurance Add-On section with all the details there! \\n\\nIf you have already booked your adventure, you\\'re welcome to add insurance to your booking with TourRadar\\'s insurance partner, XCover, by clicking the \"\"Get Travel Insurance\"\" button from the right-hand side of your booking conversation page and you\\'ll be able to add this straight away. PLEASE NOTE: Booking insurance after booking your adventure does not apply to residents of Canada. Canadians can only purchase insurance through XCover at the same time as purchasing the adventure.\\n\\nDo keep in mind that insurance requires payment upfront at the time of confirmation so we will be taking payment straight away from the card on file when your insurance policy is confirmed.\\n\\nThank you again for choosing Expat Explore Travel and TourRadar! We look forward to hearing back from you!\\n\\nKind Regards, \\nTourRadar\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"- Automatic Message -\\n\\nI am female, and travel by myself, would this fact effect the price of my travel? or there are rooms for single people?\\n\\nThank you\\nVerjineh Aghazarian\\n\\nNumber of travellers:\\n1 Adults\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"Hi Verjineh Aghazarian,\\n\\nThank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.\\n\\nWe are very excited to hear from you!\\n\\nYou\\'ve made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!\\n\\nWe offer standard twin-share accommodation which means that solo travelers are placed into a room with another solo traveler of the same gender. \\nWe understand that sharing is not for everyone so you do have the option of adding a single supplement to your booking at an extra charge.

This is similar to that of airlines - to encourage early booking. This means that the very first seats sold on the coach are the cheapest and then the seats increase in price increments as the coach sells out. This means the last seats booked on the coach are more expensive than the first.\\n\\nWith that being said, the seat price has increased to 2770.00 CAD per person and we cannot lower this rate.\\n\\nPlease note that we do not offer tailor-made or personalized itineraries. Therefore accommodation on this tour may not be altered.\\n\\nRegrettably, we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive.\\n\\nOur departures generally have one coach that seats up to 50 travelers comfortably. \\n\\nIf you are ready to book please select the \\'book now\\' button located on the left-hand side to secure your spot on Europe Escape - 12 Days. \\n\\nShould you have any other questions please don\\'t hesitate to reach out to us again on this chat. \\n\\nKindest regards,\\nNicole E\\nExpat Explore Travel\"\"\"\\r\\n14263,\"\"\"I am very disappointed in your response since this was quotation I got from touradar 2 days ago.
