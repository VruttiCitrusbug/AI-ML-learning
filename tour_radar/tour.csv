Expat Explore loves hosting families on tour and making amazing memories together. The request for triple rooms is therefore something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many hotel partners do not offer triple rooms. While they may be available in one location, triple rooms are not guaranteed to be available in all destinations. We please request that where there is an uneven number of travelers in your group, you indicate as early as possible which travelers of the same gender will be sharing a room. Please take note that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveler outside of your group's booking.

Thanks for getting in touch with us. 

Unfortunately, we are unable to take on extra luggage as their are strict weight restrictions for the coach. 
You are allowed to bring one main piece of luggage weighing no more than 20kg, and one small soft bag (such as a small daypack or backpack) for hand luggage weighing a maximum of 7kg. 

I would suggest doing research on luggage storage in order to keep your luggage safe for the duration of your tour, where you can then collect it when you disembark.

Thanks for reaching out to us, we are so happy that you are excited to join us on tour!

While being vaccinated is not an Expat Explore requirement, some of the destinations that you will be visiting may have different restrictions. Although many of the restrictions have calmed down, meaning that you might not need to quarantine, you may still need to be vaccinated when traveling there without complications. 
We do encourage our travelers to be vaccinated when traveling to European countries. 

Due to the fact that we do not require vaccination, in order to ensure the peace of mind and safety of our travellers and staff on board the coach, we are still requesting that all travellers, regardless of their vaccination status, produce a negative Covid test.
This test can be a PCR test (taken up to 72 hours before departure), an Antigen test (taken up to 48 hours before departure), or a self/home Rapid Antigen test (taken on the departure morning or the night before the tour).

Please note that testing requirements may be removed before your departure.

Thank you for reaching out with your queries. 

Due to operational constraints we are not offering additional accommodation arrangements at this time. As we encourage travellers to arrive a day before and leave the day after their tour, we recommend using this link to Booking.com to make your reservations. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the hotels in the area and the prices are competitive. Please see the link below: 
https://www.booking.com/index.html?&amp;aid=2263248

This tour is scheduled to start at: Excel Roma Montemario, Via degli Scolopi, 31, 00136 Roma RM, Italy, Tel: +39 06 3505 8043 at 07:30am


Please note that all hotels are always subject to change as we need to be ready for whatever we may encounter on the road.

Please wait to register with Sandra's new passport details as we need the most up-to-date information on our travelers and cannot accept expired passport details. 

We recommend booking your flights earlier rather than later to ensure that you get the best rates on your flights. When booking your travel arrangements, please ensure that you purchase comprehensive travel insurance as you are required to have this for your tour. 

As your deposit was made for all 4 travelers, I would recommend dividing it by 4, so 956/4 = 239.00 USD deposit each. This means that each traveler currently owes 2151.00 USD. 


Please reach out if you have any further questions.

Thanks for getting in touch with us. 

As mentioned below, we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. At the current point in time Expat Explore is unable to assist in this process, however even if you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive. Please see the link below:

Thanks for getting in touch with us. 

All phone companies in the EU must offer free roaming for calls, texts and data. 
In terms of buying them, this is very easy. Some are given away free, some are  £5, some more, it really depends on the package you buy (for example: 100mins, 5gb). In the UK you shouldn't need any proof of address or any ID to buy a top-up (PAYG = Pay As You GO) sim. Only need ID for a contract sim (pay monthly).
This should be similar in EU countries but we cannot say this as a fact. You will be able to obtain a SIM card at the airport if you do not purchase one prior.

Thanks for reaching out to us. 

The weather can be unpredictable which means you need to plan your packing in advance. Summer can be very hot and you will need to wear lighter clothing like short sleeves and shorts. If you are travelling during winter or during the cooler seasons like spring or autumn, you will need to pack a warm jacket. It is highly recommended to bring an umbrella, water-proof jacket, warm shoes, gloves, scarf and a wind-breaker in case of rain or extreme weather conditions.

It is currently Spring in Europe.

Great news! Your Europe Escape - 12 Days tour with Expat Explore starting on 04 September, 2023 has just been confirmed and you are one step closer to your adventure of a lifetime!

As a passenger with Expat Explore, you will need to fill out the following form in order to join the tour. This information is vital for us to prepare the best possible tour for you. Please make sure to complete all of the fields otherwise the form will not capture. Click the link and fill out your details:

https://expatexplore.com/cs_contact/travel-details.php?c=12325&amp;b=202302807&amp;t=1

You will be asked to select your room type on this form. The room type you have paid for is twin-share. The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many hotel partners do not offer triple rooms, and while they may be available in one location, triple rooms are not guaranteed to be available in all destinations. We please request that where there is an uneven number of travellers in your group, you indicate as early as possible which travellers of the same gender will be sharing a room. Please take note that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Once the details have been filled in on the form, please ensure you click 'Submit' to save your details.

You will also receive a Tour Leader Announcement 3 to 5 days before departure which will provide the confirmed hotel list, itinerary and your guides name and contact number.

Since most travellers are adults, minors might overhear adult conversations
Our tours are jam packed with experiences and this can mean long walking tours, early mornings/late evenings, irregular meal times and long driving days

We want all travelers to experience the most out of our tours and our walking tours and we need you to note that long driving hours can be strenuous for young children. 

If there's anything else feel free to let us know.

You can find the optional excursions, their prices and the currency needed on this link. Kindly click on the optional excursions tab: https://expatexplore.com/tours-help/?t=351 

Optional Excursions are payable in cash to your tour leader while on tour. If an excursion is pre-payable we will send an email once we are ready to accept ​pre bookings for the excursion. 

We do not however expect you to carry all of your spending money in cash while on tour. You will have many opportunities to withdraw cash from ATMs in the cities we visit and many of the souvenir shops will take a credit/debit card, I also recommend travelling with a cash passport instead of your credit card, see https://global.cashpassport.com/ . A cash passport is basically a prepaid card whereby you can buy foreign currency upfront at the set exchange rate to avoid fluctuations and hefty bank charges.

I can't imagine how time flew by... I booked my tour with you in January... it's less than a month left now. So excited.

I received an email from you guys and had a couple of questions:

1. I read that each one is allowed to have one carry on in the coach so, I got confused a little bit. What is meant by that? I mean based on the number of days of the trip, we are coming from Canada with one Carry On and one suite case for each one of us. so, where are we going to keep the other suite cases while we are in the coach?

2. I read at the beginning that there might be some excursions that we might  be able to pay before we leave. is that still on? and how we can pay 

3. The last thing for now is the surprise action to my dear wife during our 25th anniversary on September 3rd. The one I shared with you that you put a note for our leader to arrange a complimentary special thing for us. Just a kind reminder for this plan :)

Appreciate your great support

It's great to hear from you again!

Regarding the carry-on allowance on the coach, it means that each traveler is allowed to bring one main piece of luggage, which should not exceed 20kg. In addition to that, you can also bring a small soft bag like a daypack or backpack, with a maximum weight of 7kg.  The main suitcases will be securely stored in the storage area beneath the coach during the journey.

All optional excursions are bookable on tour. Payment for these excursions are done in cash directly with your tour leader during the tour.

Please take a moment to review the available optional excursions and their approximate pricing:

Thank you for reaching out.

We have many older passengers on our tours, and we are confident that you will have a great time with us, but we want to make sure that you are prepared for the tour ahead.

While we welcome all travelers above the age of 10, we would like you to be aware that Expat Explore believes the best way to get to the heart and soul of a city is on foot, surrounded by the people and the culture. For this reason, we do walking tours through most of the cities we visit. 

Many of the cities you visit are vast and old, often with steps and cobblestones. Our walking tours can last up to 3 hours and travelers are required to carry their own bags. Thus, the walking tours do require a certain level of fitness to enjoy the trip to its fullest.

Please take note of the potential challenges as listed below:
 
High Steps in the coaches,
Long guided walking tours (up to 3 hours per day),
Cobblestone streets are uneven and can make walking very tiring,
Restricted bathroom access on the coach,
Long periods without stops on the coach,
Limited time for bathroom breaks,
Bags to be carried to and from rooms,
Strict Time Schedule

Thanks for getting in touch with us. 

1) This is to inform you that due to unforeseen circumstances, we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups.

2) The majority of our travelers fly into FCO airport in Rome. 

3) At this stage, the starting hotel for your tour is:
Excel Roma Montemario				
Via degli Scolopi, 31, 00136 Roma RM, Italy, Tel: +39 06 3505 8043				 

Please note that hotels may be subject to change. 

4)You are allowed to bring one main piece of luggage weighing no more than 20kg, and one small soft bag (such as a small daypack or backpack) for hand luggage weighing a maximum of 7kg. On all tours, you will have to carry your own luggage (e.g. into hotels and up to your room if hotels don’t have elevators). Please bear this in mind when you are deciding what to pack.

5) We at Expat Explore believe that Travel Insurance is a necessity on all of our tours. We would advise that you at least cover yourself for medical repatriation. Your insurance should cover you for the following requirements: Trip Interruption, Trip Delay, Medical Expenses, Quarantine Expenses, and Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation. The insurance must also cover medical costs and a medically imposed quarantine if the insured or someone the insured has come into contact with, tests positive for COVID-19.  

You are able to obtain travel insurance through TourRadar, I will notify an agent to give you more information. 

If you have any further questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

We at Expat Explore value great customer service and always do our very best to accommodate the needs of all of our travelers, while still making sure we uphold the values and interests of the company. When it comes to a situation such as yours, we are also bound by the Terms and Conditions you agreed to upon booking.

I see that we had been informed one day prior to the start of your tour that you had to cancel due to a family emergency. While we understand that this is a very unfortunate circumstance, we are unable to refund/credit you the losses for your trip as we had already secured and honoured our contracts with our suppliers in order to make this trip possible.

Expat Explore as a tour operator has to transfer the funds paid by you to third-party suppliers to book things such as accommodation, transport, and activities well in advance. These payments are non-refundable by our suppliers at so close to departure. Losses incurred from cancellation on your part due to a family emergency should be covered by the travel insurance that Expat Explore requires you to purchase before embarking on tour.

Our cancellation policy is as follows, If you or any other member of your party decides to cancel your confirmed package you must notify us in writing or via call. If you cancel within 30 days of creating your booking and you are not yet within 45 days of departure, you will be eligible for a full refund. 

If you cancel 45 days or more before departure the cancelation charge will be loss of deposit. 
If you cancel 30 - 44 days before departure the cancelation charge will be 40% of holiday cost
If you cancel 15 - 29 days before departure the cancelation charge will be 70% of holiday cost
If you cancel 14 days or less before departure you will forfeit 100% of holiday cost

For more details on our cancellation or change policies, you can navigate to the Terms and Conditions section of our website, expatexplore.com 

As per our Terms and Conditions, unfortunately cancelling your tour this close to departure will result in a full loss of your holiday cost. We understand that the visa process can be unpredictable at times and we are so sad to hear that you have had this experience. In order to be fair and consistent with all travellers we do still need to apply the same amendment fees even when a cancellation is made because of an unsuccessful visa application.

Please advise if you'd like to proceed with the cancellation?

If you have any further questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Kind regards

Thanks for getting in touch with us. 

While being vaccinated is not an Expat Explore requirement, some of the destinations that you will be visiting may have different restrictions. Although many of the restrictions have calmed down, meaning that you might not need to quarantine, you may still need to be vaccinated when traveling there without complications. 
We do encourage our travelers to be vaccinated when traveling to European countries. 
You can keep up to date with requirements of the various countries using Sherpa.com: https://apply.joinsherpa.com/travel-restrictions?

Unfortunately, we are currently unable to assist with reserving pre and post-accommodation. Feel free to use this link to Booking.com to make reservations. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the hotels in the area and the prices are competitive.

Please note that hotels may be subject to change. 

This is to inform you that we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. At the current point in time Expat Explore is unable to assist in this process, however even if you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days tour by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

Please note that our tours say 75+, meaning that travelers over the age of 75 are welcome to join our tours if they are physically able to (you will be asked to sign an indemnity form) 

While we welcome all travelers above the age of 10, we would like you to be aware that Expat Explore believes the best way to get to the heart and soul of a city is on foot, surrounded by the people and the culture. For this reason, we do walking tours through most of the cities we visit.
Many of the cities you visit are vast and old, often with steps and cobblestones. Our walking tours can last up to 3 hours and travelers are required to carry their own bags. Thus, the walking tours do require a certain level of fitness to enjoy the trip to its fullest.
We have many older passengers on our tours, and we are confident that you will have a great time with us, but we want to make very sure that you are prepared for the tour ahead.

Please take note of the potential challenges as listed below:
&gt;High Steps in the coaches,
&gt;Long guided walking tours (up to 3 hours per day),
&gt;Cobblestone streets are uneven and can make walking very tiring,
&gt;Restricted bathroom access on the coach,
&gt;Long periods without stops on the coach,
&gt;Limited time for bathroom breaks,
&gt;Bags to be carried to and from rooms,
&gt;Strict Time Schedule

If you feel you would be able to stay with the group on this tour, we'd love to host you, this all depends on your personal fitness.

We at Expat Explore believe that Travel Insurance is a necessity on all of our tours. We would advise that you at least cover yourself for medical repatriation. This coverage needs to provide for medically necessary evacuation to a medical facility, medically equipped flights to return home, or the repatriation of mortal remains to your primary residence.

I have taken a look at both of these quotes and they seem to cover all of the necessary requirements so the choice is completely up to you. 

We do have a toilet on board the coach which can be used for emergencies only in between the rest stops. You will have rest stops at least everyone 2 to 3 hours on travel days.

We understand your situation, and we are genuinely sorry to hear about your need to cancel your booking. Our cancellation policy, as agreed upon booking, is as follows:

If the cancellation occurs within 30 days of creating your booking and you are not yet within 45 days of departure, you will be eligible for a full refund.

If you cancel 45 days or more before departure the cancelation charge will be loss of deposit. 
If you cancel 30 - 44 days before departure the cancelation charge will be 40% of holiday cost
If you cancel 15 - 29 days before departure the cancelation charge will be 70% of holiday cost
If you cancel 14 days or less before departure you will forfeit 100% of holiday cost

Since you are 38 days prior to your tour, the cancellation charge would be at 40% loss of your tour cost. This means you will need to claim the 40% loss from your travel insurer, which is Xcover. We would be more than happy to provide a travel insurance letter to aid in your claim.

We always try to accommodate our travelers as much as possible. However, given the challenges we are facing in this year of recovery, it is exceptionally difficult for us to make any exceptions.

Please confirm that we may proceed with the cancellation and provide you with a travel insurance letter to support your claim.

""What does the accommodation in twin rooms refer to? The twin room accommodations mean that you will be sharing a room with another traveler on your tour of the same gender. The size of the bed would depend on the accommodation each night.
Does this also mean that wives and husbands would share 1 room together?

Is there a list of the optional tours/excursions and price lists?""

Thank you for getting in touch with us. 

As per your tour itinerary, please note that after the meet up in Rome, the group will depart on route to Venice. If you are not able to meet at the set meeting point, you will need to make your own way to the next destination which may work out quite costly. For this reason, I would suggest booking a flight to arrive a day early and booking one nights accommodation either at the starting hotel or nearby. This will be a lot more cost effective than possible hefty travelling costs.

Please note that as per European hotel rules and policy, three travelers are not permitted to stay in one room with twin beds, this cannot be allowed. Therefore the third traveler would need to either be roomed with a fellow traveler of the same gender or purchase a single supplement.

Kindly advise who will be sharing with a fellow traveler or if you will be adding a single supplement to your booking.

We look forward to hearing from you.

&gt;Rome - Conquer the Capital:
Explore Rome and truly “conquer the capital” on this optional excursion!

&gt;Roman Food Tour
This local food tour moves through the lesser-known and more off-the-beaten-track areas of central Rome.

Begin with an authentic espresso tasting in a historic coffee shop where you’ll learn the proper way to drink Italian espresso. The tour then continues on to a prestigious bakery to try some Roman specialities before visiting a local salumeria (delicatessen) to taste exquisite cold cuts and meats. The final stop will be a classic Roman venue, where you'll be able to sample some delicious wine and taste some seasonal Roman dishes.Delizioso!

Current estimated price: € 75

These excursions are booked through third parties, some with discounts already included, unfortunately no further discounts can be applied.

Thank you for your interest in out tours!

Expat Explore loves hosting families on tour and making amazing memories together. The request for triple rooms is therefore something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. 

This is because many of our hotel partners cannot cater for triple room requests. If you are unequal numbers (3, 5, 7 etc.), the remaining traveler will be roomed with another passenger of the same gender as standard. We please request that where there is an uneven number of travellers in your group, you indicate as early as possible which travellers of the same gender will be sharing a room. Please take note that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking.

If the last traveler does not want to share a room with another traveler, there is an option to purchase a single supplement/private room upgrade. 

If you have any further questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

I booked with TourRadar 12 days European Bus Tour Reference ID [phone visible after confirmation]-FW30E.  The FAQs indicated that the itineary would be sent 2-3 weeks before the tour begins. I sent an enquiry to Expat Explore a few days ago regarding when they will send the itinerary with the confirmation & information. The Expat operator was very nice and replied quickly. She indicated that the itinerary will be sent 3-5 days prior to the tour leaving. I am a bit concerned as my flight to Rome is booked on March 23rd and I made a reservation at the BV Oly Hotel in Rome for March 24 & 25th.  According to the website the tour was to leave at the BV Oly and return there.  I asked the operator if the bus was still leaving from BV Oly Hotel. She indicated at this point the bus will be leaving from the Hotel Excel Roma Montemario at 7:30 am. Kindly note that could change.  Is there any way that the itinerary can be sent to me by March 16 or no later than March 20th.  It is very difficult to make hotel reservations and arrange for transportation from the airport especially if the details are still not finalized. Sorry I am a bit stressed out as travelling alone & first time to Europe.  Your advice is kindly appreciated. Jackie

As a passenger with Expat Explore, you will need to fill out the following form in order to join the tour. This information is vital for us to prepare the best possible tour for you. Please

https://expatexplore.com/cs_contact/travel-details.php?c=12325&amp;b=202307463&amp;t=1

You will be asked to select your room type on this form. The room type you have paid for is twin-share. The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many hotel partners do not offer triple rooms, and while they may be available in one location, triple rooms are not guaranteed to be available in all destinations. We please request that where there is an uneven number of travellers in your group, you indicate as early as possible which travellers of the same gender will be sharing a room. Please take note that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking. If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Once the details have been filled in on the form, please ensure you click 'Submit' to save your details.

You will also receive a Tour Leader Announcement 3 to 5 days before departure which will provide the confirmed hotel list, itinerary and your guides name and contact number.

I hope this message finds you well.

 As we discussed previously, I wanted to reiterate that Expat Explore Travel does not offer family or triple rooms as a standard service for our tours. This is clearly stated when booking your tour, and we do not guarantee the availability of triple rooms.

Single travelers who are provided with rooms have purchased a single supplement room upgrade at an additional cost prior to the tour commencing. These arrangements are made prior to the start of the tour.

We understand that your situation required special accommodations due to your family's needs. We did try our best to accommodate your family, even arranging last minute accommodations when necessary. Unfortunately, some locations do not have family rooms available or those rooms have already been booked by other guests.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and we appreciate your understanding. 

Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to assist you.

The single travelers have since the tour become good friends and they shared that they never paid for any upgrade. My simple question is this- having known that our family has a need for a family room why didnt the tour leader provide us the requested room and instead gave to single travelers who would have otherwise happily stayed at the given room.

You cannot keep citing policies that are not clear as the reason we were not given the convenient rooms. While the tour is over and there isnt much I can do execept for sharing my grievance online I do expect a little more openness to accept the fact that its poor planning."""

After investigating your concerns with our Operations Team, we have determined that the reason some travelers received a single room was due to an uneven number of single travelers.

Please note that we have attempted to contact you telephonically to no avail.

We apologize for any confusion or miscommunication regarding the room allocations. Please understand that Expat Explore does not typically offer triple or family rooms as part of our tour accommodations. Therefore, such requests were not made during the booking process.

The availability of family rooms in Amsterdam and Switzerland was due to our last minute negotiations with the hotels, ensuring a more comfortable stay for yourself and your family without incurring exorbitant charges (as triple rooms are charged at double the standard rate).

It is important to note that rooming lists are sent to the hotels 30 days prior to departure, and the hotels themselves allocate the rooms to the travelers. While our tour leader is unable to remove a traveler from their assigned room, if a traveler voluntarily agrees to switch to a smaller room and both parties agreed, arrangements could be made.

We appreciate your patience as we thoroughly investigated the matter at hand.

After engaging in multiple discussions, we discovered that your tour leader had requested a double or family room at each location. The decision to grant a family room at the Excel Roma Montemario was made as a gesture of goodwill. Michelle did indeed make a private request for this accommodation. However, please understand that at the time of her request, the hotel was unable to make the necessary arrangements and once you asked as well, was this only granted by the hotel.

Regarding the situation where you were placed on a different floor from your family, this was purely for administrative purposes and for the sake of maintaining accurate paperwork and lists. Michelle was made aware beforehand that you would not be sharing a room with another traveler and would be sharing the twin room with your family instead.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused and we hope that we have addressed all of your concerns.

This is redundant information. You had already made it clear after conversing with our tour leader this information. Did you try calling the hotels and validating the information?

The decision to grant a family room at Excel Roma was made on my repeated insistence and not my tour leader's request to the receptionist. If I could get a family room after sensing its availability why wasnt my tour leader able to get it when she was helping us check in?

Additionally, as mentioned during the call there were 4 other hotels - Paris, Munich, Venice, Rhine valley where I got confirmation from the receptionist the next morning that a family room was indeed available. I ended up being un-necesarrily respectful of the tour leader thinking that she would be representing our fair ask.

We are very excited that you are joining our Expat Explore Tour! We’re mailing you to inform you about Travel Insurance.

We at Expat Explore believe that Travel Insurance is a necessity on all of our tours. We would advise that you at least cover yourself for medical repatriation. This coverage needs to provide for medically necessary evacuation to a medical facility, medically equipped flights to return home, or the repatriation of mortal remains to your primary residence.

When filling out your Important Passenger Information, we will ask you for the name of your insurer as well as the policy number. This will ensure that should you need medical assistance, the tour leader will at least have the relevant information on hand to be able to assist you.

You are able to obtain adequate travel insurance through TourRadar, one of their agents can give you more info.

The cruises listed are covered within out Europe Escape package, entrance to museums and other historical sites are excluded unless explicitly stated, our standard accommodation is twin share, this means that two travelers will share one room, if there are two travelers on the same booking, you will share one room, each room will either have air-conditioning or windows for ventilation. In our experience the average age of travelers are 35-55 years old and dinner is usually at the designated hotels. We do allow for eating on the bus and using the onboard toilet for emergencies.

Lake Como is an upscale resort area known for its dramatic scenery, set against the foothills of the Alps. Flights and travel insurance are not included in this tour package.

At the end of your tour you will have the opportunity to thank your Expat Explore tour leader and driver by offering them a tip. We suggest somewhere between €4-6  person per day.

We booked out tour ""Europe Escape-12 days"" and we are looking for to start the adventure soon.

There are few things that we would like to confirm prior to our departure.

We understand that we need to be at 7am at the hotel to start the tour.

We will arrive to Rome on 21st April at 13:25 Terminal three, at FCO airport. We are wondering if the tour company can pick us up from the airport on our arrival? Our flight number is 97/388. We'll fly with Emirates from Dubai. I haven't check if airport transfer was included or not. Either way we would like to be picked up.

If that is not possible, we would like to know from which hotel our trip will be started on 23th April. We would like to stay in that hotel from 21st to 23rd for our convince.

Please let us to know.

Looking forward to hear back from you soon.

Thank you"""

Thanks for getting in touch with us. 

For shorter itineraries most travellers are able to pack enough clothes to last them for the duration of the trip. For longer tours, you may need to plan for doing your laundry during the tour. Your tour leader will be able to recommend the best place for this.

Hotel laundry services are less common in Europe and can be very expensive, so the tour leader’s recommendation will most likely be a local laundromat in a destination where you have at least a two-night stay. In bigger cities you may be able to use a laundry service, who will pick up from the hotel and then deliver the clean clothes back to reception. These services are operated by third-parties so your tour leader and Expat Explore will not be responsible for any issues - try not to bring any clothes with you that are valuable or sentimental in case of loss or damage.

Alternatively, you could wash your clothes in the sink/wash basin in your hotel room, particularly if it's smaller items like socks and underwear. If you do, take care not to be too obvious when you hang them up to dry as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms. We suggest doing this in destinations where you spend two or more nights so the clothes have as much time to dry as possible.

You will be asked to select your room type on this form. The room type you have paid for is twin-share. 
The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many hotel partners do not offer triple rooms, and while they may be available in one location, triple rooms are not guaranteed to be available in all destinations. We please request that where there is an uneven number of travellers in your group, you indicate as early as possible which travellers of the same gender will be sharing a room. Please take note that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single rooms are subject to availability and given that this departure is just over a month away, I cannot confirm that we will be able to offer this.

Thank you for reaching out to us, 

The tour is scheduled to start at Excel Roma Montemario at 07:30 am, the scheduled end time of the tour is after breakfast (roughly 10:00 am)

Your tour leader will be able to recommend the best place for this.

Hotel laundry services are less common in Europe and can be very expensive, so the tour leader’s recommendation will most likely be a local laundromat in a destination where you have at least a two-night stay. In bigger cities you may be able to use a laundry service, who will pick up from the hotel and then deliver the clean clothes back to reception. These services are operated by third-parties so your tour leader and Expat Explore will not be responsible for any issues - try not to bring any clothes with you that are valuable or sentimental in case of loss or damage

If you have any further questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

I hope you're well and getting excited for your tour. 

Please note that optional excursions are to be paid in cash to your tour leader. 

Jungfraujoch: Journey to the Top of Europe:
Experience a highlight of European travel when you journey to Jungfraujoch -  the top of Europe! Take the Eiger Express cable car to 3,454m above sea level. Get ready for breathtaking mountain views as you go, the trip is part of the adventure! Arrive at Jungfraujoch which is the highest train station in Europe and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Enjoy the year-round snow, take in the panoramic alpine scenery, marvel at the massive Aletsch Glacier and explore the magical ice palace and Sphinx Observatory! Return by cable car or Jungfraubahn train for even more spectacular mountain vistas. This optional excursion has been voted number one by Expat Explore travellers for several years and comes highly recommended!

Please Note: Certain departures will stay in a different region of the Swiss Alps, with the 'Swiss Alps Mountain Experience' excursion offered in place of Jungfraujoch.

Price: € 195 per person

Thank you for your response, 

The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many of our hotel partners cannot cater for triple room requests. If you are unequal numbers (3, 5, 7 etc.), the remaining traveler will be roomed with another passenger of the same gender as standard. 

If the last traveler does not want to share a room with another traveler, there is an option to purchase a single supplement/private room upgrade. For this tour the single supplement is currently 965.00 AUD.

Our standard accommodation is twin share, where 8 travelers will be accommodated in 4 twin share rooms. Each room is equipped with two twin beds and an ensuite bathroom.

If you're interested in adding a single supplement, kindly let us know, as this option is subject to availability. 

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for reaching out to us, 

We use one coach that can accommodate up to 48 travelers.

We would like you to be aware that Expat Explore believes the best way to get to the heart and soul of a city is on foot, surrounded by the people and the culture. For this reason, we do walking tours through most of the cities we visit.  

Many of the cities we visit are vast and old, often with steps and cobblestones. Our walking tours can last up to 3 hours and travelers are required to carry their own bags. Thus, the walking tours do require a certain level of fitness to enjoy the trip to its fullest.

European policy is strict regarding the weight of coaches, as this is quite a packed tour,  and each traveler is allocated a luggage quota, exceeding the allowed coach weight could result in a fine and we, therefore need to enforce this luggage restriction as per the below:

You are allowed to bring one main piece of luggage weighing no more than 20kg, and one small soft bag (such as a small daypack or backpack) for hand luggage weighing a maximum of 7kg. On all tours, you will have to carry your own luggage (e.g. into hotels and up to your room if hotels don’t have elevators). Please bear this in mind when you are deciding what to pack.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

We look forward to hosting you!

Regrettably, we no longer offer triple rooms. Our rooms are standard twin-share with an en suite bathroom. Where there are three travelers on a booking, the third traveler will be roomed within another solo traveler of the same gender. 
We also have the option of adding a single supplement to your booking at an additional cost, which will allow the third traveler to have their own room, however this is subject to availability.

Great news! Your Europe Escape - 12 Days starting on 30 Jul, 2023 has just been confirmed and you are one step closer to your adventure of a lifetime!

As a passenger with Expat Explore, you will need to fill out the following form in order to join the tour. This information is vital for us to prepare the best possible tour for you. Please make sure to complete all of the fields otherwise the form will not capture. Click the link and fill out your details:

https://expatexplore.com/cs_contact/travel-details.php?c=12325&amp;b=202311045&amp;t=1

You will be asked to select your room type on this form. The room type you have paid for is twin-share. 
The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many hotel partners do not offer triple rooms, and while they may be available in one location, triple rooms are not guaranteed to be available in all destinations. We please request that where there is an uneven number of travellers in your group, you indicate as early as possible which travellers of the same gender will be sharing a room. 
Please take note that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single supplements are subject to availability.
Once the details have been filled in on the form, please ensure you click 'Submit' to save your details.

You will also receive a Tour Leader Announcement 3 to 5 days before departure which will provide the confirmed hotel list, itinerary and your guides name and contact number.

Please take 3 minutes to watch this short video with all the information and travel checks you should be aware of before starting your tour:

Expat Explore loves hosting families on tour and making amazing memories together. The request for triple rooms is therefore something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many of our hotel partners cannot cater for triple room requests.

Thank you for your response, 

This is to inform you that due to unforeseen circumstances, we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. At the current point in time Expat Explore is unable to assist in this process, however even if you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive

Please note that there are no further discounts for this departure, Expat Explore works on a bucket pricing system, this means that the more seats are sold on a departure, the more the rest of the seats increase. This is to encourage early booking.

Thank you for contacting us, 

Regarding your arrival in Rome on September 24th, if your flight lands between 7:55 am and 8:30 am, we recommend aiming to meet up with the group in Venice instead. The tour is set to depart from Rome to Venice at 8:00 am. The group is expected to reach Venice around 15:00 pm, and the designated hotel in Venice is currently Hotel Venezia, Via Teatro Vecchio 5, 30171 Mestre, Italy, Tel: +39 041 985533. Please keep in mind that accommodations could potentially change, although this is unlikely.

For your convenience, you can expect to receive your confirmed tour program 3-5 days before departure via direct email. This will consist of your tour leader's details as well. On the day of departure, feel free to reach out to your tour leader to stay updated on the group's progress and to confirm the meeting point.

Concerning optional excursions, you can book them directly with your tour leader while on tour. Payments for these optional excursions needs to be made in cash. To assist you in planning, please take a moment to review the available optional excursions and approximate pricing on the provided link.

https://expatexplore.com/tours-help/europe-escape/

It is impossible to say exactly how much you will need during your tour. However, we would recommend budgeting €25-€40 per day (this excludes optional excursions) and this will vary depending on how much you wish to spend on snacks, drinks, souvenirs, optional excursions etc.

If you do not have cash on your person, your tour leader would be more than happy to direct you to an ATM or exchange kiosk.

We're here to make your journey smooth and memorable. 

Should you have any further inquiries or require assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

We're excited to have you join us on this adventure.

We are happy to confirm that we do currently have availability on our 24th September 2023 departure. 

At this stage the starting point of your tour is Excel Roma Montemario. Kindly note that this may be subject to change.

At Expat Explore we use a bucket pricing system to price and sell our seats. This is similar to that of airlines - to encourage early booking. This means that the very first seats sold on the coach are the cheapest and then the seats increase in price increments as the coach sells out. This means the last seats booked on the coach are more expensive than the first. 

This means that the current seats available are the cheapest available and may increase as the our fills up.

Expat Explore believes the best way to get to the heart and soul of a city is on foot, surrounded by the people and the culture. For this reason, we do walking tours through most of the cities we visit.  Many of the cities we visit are vast and old, often with steps and cobblestones. Our walking tours can last up to 3 hours and travelers are required to carry their own bags. Thus, the walking tours do require a certain level of fitness to enjoy the trip to its fullest.

You will be asked to select your room type on this form. The room type you have paid for is twin-share. 
The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many hotel partners do not offer triple rooms, and while they may be available in one location, triple rooms are not guaranteed to be available in all destinations. 
We please request that where there is an uneven number of travellers in your group, you indicate as early as possible which travellers of the same gender will be sharing a room. Please take note that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single supplements are subject to availability.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days tour by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

All travelers are required to carry their own bags, get on and off the coach and use public transport. Our city walking tours can last up to 3 hours and certain places involve walking up and down lots of steps. We want you to enjoy your tour, so read through the itinerary thoroughly and make your own conclusions as to whether you feel that you are fit and healthy enough.

Hotel laundry services are less common in Europe and can be very expensive, so the tour leader’s recommendation will most likely be a local laundromat in a destination where you have at least a two-night stay. In bigger cities you may be able to use a laundry service, who will pick up from the hotel and then deliver the clean clothes back to reception. These services are operated by third-parties so your tour leader and Expat Explore will not be responsible for any issues - try not to bring any clothes with you that are valuable or sentimental in case of loss or damage.

Thank you for reaching out to us,

To the best of our knowledge, as a holder of a US passport, you are not required to obtain a visa for entry into Europe. However, we strongly recommend verifying this information with your local consulate as we are not a registered visa agency.

Regrettably, we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive. Please see the link below: 

https://www.book-online-transfers.com/en/expatexplore-airport-taxi

At this stage the starting point of your tour is Excel Roma Montemario (Via degli Scolopi, 31, 00136 Roma RM, Italy, Tel: +39 06 3505 8043)

Kindly note that this may be subject to change.

A Tour Radar agent will be in contact regarding payment.

If you have any further questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days tour by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

When you book with Expat Explore you are signing up for a jam-packed coach tour. In order to make sure that all our travelers see the most for their money. Upon having a look at the current schedule for this tour, it is unlikely that there will be a substantial amount of free time while in Germany to drive on the Autobahn unless you choose to forego some of the activities on the itinerary in order to make time for this.

If you are ready to book please select the 'book now' button located on the left-hand side to secure your spot on Europe Escape - 12 Days. 

Should you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us again on this chat.

Great news! Your Europe Escape - 12 Days starting on 02 Oct, 2023 has just been confirmed and you are one step closer to your adventure of a lifetime!

As a passenger with Expat Explore, you will need to fill out the following form in order to join the tour. This information is vital for us to prepare the best possible tour for you. Please make sure to complete all of the fields otherwise the form will not capture. Click the link and fill out your details:

https://expatexplore.com/cs_contact/travel-details.php?c=12325&amp;b=202316443&amp;t=1

You will be asked to select your room type on this form. The room type you have paid for is twin-share. 
The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many hotel partners do not offer triple rooms, and while they may be available in one location, triple rooms are not guaranteed to be available in all destinations. 
We please request that where there is an uneven number of travellers in your group, you indicate as early as possible which travellers of the same gender will be sharing a room. Please take note that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking. 

If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. 

Once the details have been filled in on the form, please ensure you click 'Submit' to save your details.

You will also receive a Tour Leader Announcement 3 to 5 days before departure which will provide the confirmed hotel list, itinerary and your guides name and contact number.

Thank you for reaching out to us again.

For Travel Insurance, we hope for our customers to get one that at least covers Tour Cancellations and Tour Disruptions because per our Terms and Conditions, cancellations at the last minute or leaving the tour due to emergencies does not result to a refund. So having an Insurance would allow you to recoup some if not all of the amount that you paid for your Tour.

We mostly recommend a Company called World Nomads. https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-insurance?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAuNGuBhAkEiwAGId4asDiNbA5hRWGVgCV6A3XM6M0E8bOiAyAjsKxnJ4JZGhVXIyqRAEgghoCZdIQAvD_BwE

However, Tour Radar does offer Travel Insurance as well and you can check the info in your BCP.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

There will be a small fridge at the front of the coach where you can store the necessary medication, the hotels will most likely have a mini fridge as well. Please be sure to note all medical conditions and requirements on your Important Passenger Information forms. 
______________________________________________________

For shorter itineraries most travellers are able to pack enough clothes to last them for the duration of the trip. For longer tours, you may need to plan for doing your laundry during the tour. Your tour leader will be able to recommend the best place for this.

Hotel laundry services are less common in Europe and can be very expensive, so the tour leader’s recommendation will most likely be a local laundromat in a destination where you have at least a two-night stay. In bigger cities you may be able to use a laundry service, who will pick up from the hotel and then deliver the clean clothes back to reception. These services are operated by third-parties so your tour leader and Expat Explore will not be responsible for any issues - try not to bring any clothes with you that are valuable or sentimental in case of loss or damage.
________________________________________________________

It is impossible to say exactly what you will need during your tour. Please refer to the tour itinerary for full details of what activities are included, which meals are included and what is excluded.

We would recommend budgeting €25-€40 per day (this excludes optional excursions) and this will vary depending on how much you wish to spend on snacks, drinks, souvenirs, optional excursions etc.

Most facilities will accept credit/debit cards, however we do not recommend that you solely rely on cards as there will be times when a computer is down, the machine has run out of money or some other problem arises and cash is not available! It is therefore advisable to always have a small amount of cash-on-hand for emergencies.

It is usually possible to exchange money into the local currency after arriving in the country - your tour leader will be happy to assist you when arriving in a country that requires a new currency, but the easiest way is to make a withdrawal from a local cash machine. By withdrawing from an ATM you will also usually get a much better exchange rate than at a foreign exchange shop/kiosk.

I hope this information gives you some clarity and if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your reply!

The seat cost for your tour is at 2,290 USD per person and that is the amount that each one needs to pay except for Enriquito who cancelled but needs to pay (already paid) the deposit of 229 USD. Now the Single Supplement is an additional cost on top of the 2,290 USD and I am seeing that the updated price is now at 1,034.35 USD.

Triple Share is not possible for our tours. Please note that as per European hotel rules and policy, three travelers are not permitted to stay in one room with twin beds, this cannot be allowed. Therefore the third traveler would need to either be roomed with a fellow traveler of the same gender or purchase a single supplement.

When it comes to schedule, what we have is just the standard itinerary which shows the highlight/summary for each day. The actual schedule with timings are with the Tour Leader which is finalized before the tour, and your Tour Leader will be the one to brief the customers on the Day 1 Orientation. 

However, what I can share is that on the Free Days of the Itinerary, you have the whole day to enjoy the City that you are in and you can plan out the day to start any time after the included Breakfast at the Hotel which is usually between 6-8AM.

Thanks for reaching out to us. 

For most of our tours, the starting hotel is the meeting point/pick up point as this makes check in a lot easier. Given that your tour departs to Venice after the pick up, you will not be checking in. 

The currently provisioned meeting point for your tour is BW Blu Hotel Roma				
Largo Domenico De Dominicis, 4, 00159 Roma RM, Italy - Tel +39 06 438 2000				

Please note that hotels may be subject to change leading up to your departure and it will be best to get confirmation closer to the time. 

I would suggest enquiring about luggage storage with this hotel or somewhere nearby, luggage storage is quite a popular service. Given the strict luggage restrictions of the coach, you will not be able to bring the large bag along with you. 
Alternatively, you could try Stasher, Stow Your Bags or even enquire with the airport.

Expat Explore believes the best way to get to the heart and soul of a city is on foot, surrounded by the people and the culture. For this reason, we do walking tours through most of the cities we visit.

Many of the cities you visit are vast and old, often with steps and cobblestones. Our walking tours can last up to 3 hours and travelers are required to carry their own bags. Thus, the walking tours do require a certain level of fitness to enjoy the trip to its fullest.

Thank you so much for reaching out!

Please note that we can no longer split the booking because of a couple of factors.

Since the booking was made more than 30 Days ago, if we remove seats from this booking, that will be considered as cancelled seats on the system and the deposit will be lost for each seat removed.

The seats offered for this tour is now offered at a different price, so if we create a new booking for the travelers who will be split, their seat price will be the current website price and not the price that the seats were sold at for this booking.

On the other hand, may I know why you wanted to split the booking? If it is related to making separate payments, I can ask assistance from Tour Radar to check options if you wish to pay separately.

Also, for rooming assignments. Please note that we cannot accommodate a Triple Share as we only offer twin share for the included accommodations. You may indicate the room pairings in the IPI Page. https://expatexplore.com/cs_contact/login?c=12325&amp;b=202321392

Thank you so much for your message.

As it stands, you should not worry regarding payments because as long as you are the lead traveler, you will have control over the booking. This means that if you have any travelers within the group who are not able to make the payment on the due date, you can request to have their seats cancelled at the loss of their deposit. Your seats are ensured as long as you make payments for your and your sons' seats.

For rooming, since we cannot accommodate 3 pax in 1 room and both your sons are under 18, one needs to be paired with another adult from your group while the other 1 is paired with you.

14263,1170,924292,1847858,customer,operator,message,2024-03-11 22:44:20,"""Hi Albert,

Yes, if you and your 2 minor sons will be the only ones remaining for this booking, then we cannot push through due to the rule that minors need to each be paired with an adult within your group. Also, cancelling the booking at this point will result to the loss of deposit as we only have a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee. This is discussed in section B4 of our Terms and Conditions. https://expatexplore.com/terms-conditions/

However, I wanted to present an alternate solution for you. We do offer unlimited tour or tour date changes to our travelers, and as long as the tour or tour date change is requested at least 76 Days or more from the start date, then it will not result to any amendment fees.

So if your travel companions cannot travel then instead if cancelling, we can change the tour or tour date to a more suitable date for everyone. Or in the event that it will only be the 3 of you left due to cancellations, then maybe we can change the tour to a more later date since 1 of your sons will be 18 this November. So if we change it to a date close to or after November then I can make the request to have him considered as an adult.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

The request for family rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. Our standard accommodation is twin share. Kindly note that minors are not legally allowed to share a hotel room.

Please note that prices do not include airport transfers.

It is difficult to say exactly how much time is spent travelling as this depends on the day and how far the next destination is. However, we do provide comfort breaks at least every two hours.

It is impossible to say exactly what you will need during your tour. We would recommend budgeting €25-€40 per day (this excludes optional excursions) and this will vary depending on how much you wish to spend on snacks, drinks, souvenirs, optional excursions etc.

We have the following departures available for 4 travelers for our Europe Escape Tour:
Sunday 3 Sep 2023 - Thursday 14 Sep 2023
Monday 4 Sep 2023 - Friday 15 Sep 2023
Sunday 10 Sep 2023 - Thursday 21 Sep 2023

Thank you for getting in touch with us, 

Regrettably, we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive. Please see the link below: 

https://www.book-online-transfers.com/en/expatexplore-airport-taxi

For public transportation: https://www.rome2rio.com/

A single supp/private room upgrade for this tour is currently 735.00 USD per person. This will ensure that you have your own bedroom and private bathroom for the entire tour.

At the end of your tour you will have the opportunity to thank your Expat Explore tour leader and driver by offering them a tip. We suggest somewhere between €5-€7 per person per day. Tipping is entirely voluntary and the above rate is offered as a suggested guide only.

All optional excursions are bookable on tour in cash (Euro), directly with your tour leader. Please take a moment to review the available optional excursions and approximate pricing on the link below:

Unfortunately, due to the exponential increase in people wanting to travel, hotels are struggling to keep up with the demand for rooms and as such can only provide tour companies with a limited number of rooms. This provides us with a never-before-experienced dilemma of having a limited number of single rooms we can offer on any given tour. 

As mentioned, the single rooms are thus subject to availability and sold on a first-come-first-served basis. With this in mind, I regret to have to inform you that after some discussion with our operations team, there are no longer single rooms available on your tour.

As mentioned during the quoting process, rooms are subject to availability.

Typically, our rooming lists are sent to hotels around 30 days before the tour departure. While our operations team sometimes manages to secure single rooms closer to the departure date, unfortunately, in this instance, the hotels no longer have the necessary availability.

Thank you for your message, 

Expat Explore tries to be as accommodating as possible, however, our tours are unfortunately not designed for people travelling with wheelchairs or severe mobility issues.

Our tours are fast paced because they are designed for you to see the most a destination has to offer. We also want to ensure that you explore as much as possible, which may require long periods without stops on the coach as we drive to new destination.

We offer walking tours in most cities (up to 3 hours), and a wheelchair is not always a practical option as there are often cobbled streets and stairs on these tours.

For travellers in wheelchairs, you will only be able to store your wheelchair under the coach with the other luggage. Thus, on the long drives between cities you will not necessarily have access to your wheelchair if we make a quick bathroom stop along the way. Please note that travelling with a wheelchair could prove difficult as our coaches don't have wheelchair lifts, as such you will need to be able to board and alight the coach on your own.

With regards to our accommodation, not all hotels have lifts and this can potentially mean having to carry bags up and down stairs.

Please advise if you would like to proceed with this booking, with the above being noted?

We look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your response, 

At Expat Explore we use a bucket pricing system to price and sell our seats. This is similar to that of airlines - to encourage early booking. This means that the very first seats sold on the coach are the cheapest and then the seats increase in price increments as the coach sells out. This means the last seats booked on the coach are more expensive than the first. This also leads to the seat prices being different, depending on the time you booked and why some departures are cheaper than others.

Please note that direct bookings were made prior to your request, which is why the price is currently 2405.00 USD. 

Please advise if you would like to proceed with this booking?

Welcome to the Expat Explore Family! This email is a confirmation that your Europe Escape - 12 Days starting on 24 Mar, 2024 is now confirmed and that you are one step closer to the adventure of a lifetime and we look forward to hosting you and your travel companion(s)! 

As you know, there is always some admin and in order to get ours done, we need the following information (as per passport)  from you and all the people who will be joining you in making exciting life-enriching memories. 

Full Names
Dates of Birth
Gender
Mobility concerns
Dietary requirements

If there is an uneven number of travellers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveller or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking.

Please email us the above information and if you are able to at this time, we would also appreciate you filling out the Important Passenger Information form.

https://expatexplore.com/cs_contact/travel-details?c=12325&amp;b=202324175

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveller. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets. 

This list of Frequently asked questions should answer any further questions you may have but if you have more, simply please reach out to our team on this platform or via WhatsApp using the following number + 447731943978.

As previously mentioned, at Expat Explore we use a bucket pricing system to price and sell our seats. This is similar to that of airlines - to encourage early booking. This means that the very first seats sold on the coach are the cheapest and then the seats increase in price increments as the coach sells out. This means the last seats booked on the coach are more expensive than the first. This also leads to the seat prices being different, depending on the time you booked and why some departures are cheaper than others.

Please note that direct bookings were made prior to your request, which is why the price is currently 2405.00 USD.

Upon calling Tour Radar on 22 August 2023, you spoke to Anita and indicated you were accepting the amount of 2405.00 USD, thereby confirming your booking.

Thank you for reaching out to us, 

Unfortunately, we are no longer able to assist with reserving pre and post-accommodation. Feel free to use this link to Booking.com to make reservations. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the hotels in the area and the prices are competitive.
Please see the link below: https://www.booking.com/index.html?&amp;aid=2263248

At this stage, your departure is too far in advance for us to give you a confirmed starting hotel. Due to the fact that our hotels are subject to change, we do not provide inaccurate information beforehand to minimize any confusion that may be caused. We therefore suggest reaching out roughly 90 days prior for this information.

1. How does the airport transfer work?  Is there a link and where do we transfer to from the airport?  
2.  Where will the meeting place be the morning of June 2 on Day 1?  We are coming in the day before and are looking at booking a hotel and want to do it in the same area if possible.
3.  Day 1 in Venice - what time is the tour over in Venice on that day?  Referring to when the ""free time"" time period will be that is referenced in the itinerary.
4. Day 7 - Burgundy region in France - what time period is the free time referenced in the itinerary before we get on the bus?  Just wanting to know how much time there will be for exploring.
5.  Day 8 - Swiss Alps free day - we are planning on doing the Jungfrajoch excursion.  Is this an all day event?  What time does the tour start and when do we return?  Wanting to know if we should plan something for either after or before the tour - exploring more, dinner, etc.
6.  Day 10 - Night of day 10.  What and where is the hotel that we will be staying at.  I want to start looking at transit options from the hotel to the vatican area.  
7.  Day 11 - Night of day 11.  What and were is the hotel that we will be staying at.  We leave fairly early the next day and I want to start looking and scheduling transfers to the airport for the next morning.

14263,1170,937843,1875573,customer,operator,message,2024-02-02 10:01:18,"""Hi James, 

Thank you for getting in touch with us. 

The answers to your questions can be found below: 

1) Regrettably, we can no longer assist with transfers. We recommend using public transport for airport-to-hotel transportation. If you prefer a transfer service, you can easily book through Welcome Pickups, a user-friendly platform with competitive prices. Visit the link below for more information:

https://www.book-online-transfers.com/en/expatexplore-airport-taxi

Alternatively: https://www.rome2rio.com/

2) At this stage, the meeting point for your tour is BW Blu Hotel Roma				
Largo Domenico De Dominicis, 4, 00159 Roma RM, Italy - Tel +39 06 438 2000				

Please note that hotels may be subject to change if we encounter any unforeseen operational issues. 

3) On Day 1, free time will start at 18h30 however there is a Water Taxi optional excursion on offer during that time. You are welcome to join that optional or you can use the evening to venture out on your own to explore the city. 

4) On Day 7, you will arrive in Beaune at approximately 11h30am. You will then have a short orientation tour and then about 1 hour and 30mins for free time. 

5) Day 8: Breakfast is at 07h30am and the Jungfraujoch optional excursion will take place thereafter. This excursion will take up most of the day and you will return in the early evening before the optional Swiss dinner. If you do not join the dinner, you are welcome to stay and purchase dinner at the hotel or visit a restaurant nearby. 

6) At this stage, the hotel you'll be staying at in Rome is BW Blu Hotel Roma			
Largo Domenico De Dominicis. 

As mention, hotels may be subject to change. 

7) On night 10 &amp; 11 you will be staying at the same hotel, as mentioned above. 

8) Travel insurance is mandatory when travelling with us. A suitable insurance policy should provide adequate cover for medical expenses arising through illness or accident prior to or during the holiday, and loss of holiday monies through cancellation or curtailment of the holiday or other insurable reasons. You should ensure that there are no exclusion clauses limiting protection for the type of activities in your tour. When on tour, ensure you keep personal belongings on you at all times and that your suitcase/backpack has a lock on it, especially in tourist areas. It may be advisable to wear a money belt to store money, credit cards and passport.


I hope this information gives you some clarity and if there's anything else you need assistance with, please feel free to reach out.

14263,1170,937843,1875573,customer,operator,message,2024-03-08 00:27:59,"""Hi James,

We highly recommend obtaining comprehensive travel insurance, ensuring you won't need to worry about emergencies that can happen anytime, anywhere, before or during your travels. 

Insurance can cover the cost of your airfare, as well as your adventufre(s) in the case of an unforeseen cancellation. It ensures that you do not have to worry about any unplanned changes to your travel plans, such as having to rush home to an ill family member or having an adventure changed or cancelled because of a natural disaster. It can even help with smaller things - like lost luggage or stolen cameras.

When selecting a travel insurance policy we recommend a minimum coverage of USD 200,000 for repatriation and emergency rescue. We strongly recommend that the policy also covers personal liability, medical, cancellation, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects.

Before you book your adventure, you're welcome to obtain a quote with TourRadar's insurance partner, XCover, and check out the policy details by clicking into the date you're looking to travel from the adventure details page. You'll see the Insurance Add-On section with all the details there! 

If you have already booked your adventure, you're welcome to add insurance to your booking with TourRadar's insurance partner, XCover, by clicking the ""Get Travel Insurance"" button from the right-hand side of your booking conversation page and you'll be able to add this straight away. PLEASE NOTE: Booking insurance after booking your adventure does not apply to residents of Canada. Canadians can only purchase insurance through XCover at the same time as purchasing the adventure.

Do keep in mind that insurance requires payment upfront at the time of confirmation so we will be taking payment straight away from the card on file when your insurance policy is confirmed.

Thank you again for choosing Expat Explore Travel and TourRadar! We look forward to hearing back from you!

Kind Regards,

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

At Expat Explore we use a bucket pricing system to price and sell our seats. This is similar to that of airlines - to encourage early booking. This means that the very first seats sold on the coach are the cheapest and then the seats increase in price increments as the coach sells out. This means the last seats booked on the coach are more expensive than the first.

With that being said, the seat price has increased to 2770.00 CAD per person and we cannot lower this rate.

Please note that we do not offer tailor-made or personalized itineraries. Therefore accommodation on this tour may not be altered.

Regrettably, we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive.

Our departures generally have one coach that seats up to 50 travelers comfortably. 

If you are ready to book please select the 'book now' button located on the left-hand side to secure your spot on Europe Escape - 12 Days. 

Should you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us again on this chat.

As previously mentioned, Expat Explore Travel operates on a bucket pricing system. This means that there are a limited number of seats available at specific prices.

Thank you for your email, please see the information below regarding the process involved in our adventures.

For our European adventures, certain nationalities need a Schengen visa and/or UK tourist visa. We strongly advise you to speak to the relevant Embassy in your home country. Apply to the embassy of the country where you spend the greatest number of nights on adventure. If there is more than one destination with the same number of nights then you must choose the
embassy of the country that you enter first. Please check here for more information. Regarding the ETIAS regulations that are set to fall into place, we recommend you read this
blog post for more information: https://expatexplore.com/blog/etias-questions-need-to-know/

We can provide travellers requiring visas with visa support documents on a request basis, providing that you are within the required cut off dates and times. The documents will be
emailed to you and you must print them and take them with you as a hard copy. This will include (if necessary):

- E-ticket
- Adventure Itinerary
- Accommodation List
- Visa Letter

Please note that you are required to pay for your adventure in full in order to receive the documents. This is an embassy/consulate requirement by law. Once you have made the full
payment please contact us to request the documents, and allow at least 3\5 working days for your documents to be issued. Please note that you can only request these documents if you are travelling within the next 3 months.

Please allow sufficient time to complete the visa process. Although we are very thorough when creating these documents, you must check them for any mistakes - spelling, dates etc.
Any mistakes will affect your visa application and prolong the process.

Should your visa application be unsuccessful you should notify us as soon as possible and be aware that cancellation fees apply, as below:
- Your deposit is always non-refundable. If your visa application is rejected then it
depends on how many days are left before your adventure departs as to how much money you will
lose.
- You will also be given an opportunity to change your adventure date (subject to availability)
so that you have time to reapply for your visa, however, there will be an amendment charged
- please refer to our Terms and Conditions.

If you have any questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact us. Or get in touch with one of our 24-hour online chat agents, found on the bottom-left of our Expat Explore
contact us page.

See you soon for the adventure of a lifetime!

Thank you for reaching out to us, 

Due to the nature of our tours being packed with activities and extensive walking, we have established a minimum age limit of 10 years old, as they may not be suitable for young children. However, Expat Explore may exercise discretion and potentially consider younger children for specific tours if they fulfill certain criteria. However, as this tour is 3 days away from departure, there are no longer any spaces available.

Expat Explore requires that you take out a policy of insurance in order to cover you and your party against the cost of cancellation by you; the cost of assistance (including repatriation - medical and non-medical) in the event of accident or illness; loss of baggage and money.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

That is correct. The price shown is per person.

Please also note that as per European hotel rules and policy, three travelers are not permitted to stay in one room with twin beds, this cannot be allowed. Therefore the third traveler would need to either be roomed with a fellow traveler of the same gender or purchase a single supplement.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. 

This is because many of our hotel partners cannot cater for triple room requests. If you are unequal numbers (3, 5, 7 etc.), the remaining traveler will be roomed with another passenger of the same gender as standard. 

Please take a moment to review the available optional excursions below:

Venice Water Taxi - € 25	
Something to add to your Venetian experience is a cruise of the canals on a classic water taxi. Cruise along in style on these wooden motorboats with their leather seats and private drivers. Explore the Grand Canal, the main highway of the Floating City, and see some of the main sights like the Santa Maria Della Salute church, the cemetery island of San Michele and the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore.

Venice Gondola Ride - € 25	
A gondola ride is the perfect way to appreciate the beauty and charm of Venice. Feel part of an ancient Venetian tradition and experience Venice as the locals have for more than a thousand years. Your visit isn't complete until you have experienced this!

Please Note: Gondolas can take up to 5 people, so you will be sharing your experience with other members of your Expat Explore group. After 19:00 hrs the cost will increase by an additional €5.00 per person.

Paris+ - € 60
Join your tour leader on an unforgettable day out in Paris! Look forward to enjoying classic French experiences. These include tasting macarons at the world-famous Ladurée, strolling through the beautiful Place Vendôme and a guided tour of the Fragonard Musée du Parfum. You’ll also visit Montparnasse Tower for panoramic views of Paris, take in the impressive views of the Eiffel Tower from Champ de Mars, enjoy a sightseeing River Seine cruise with food and drinks on board, and visit the vibrant Latin Quarter where the tour ends. Here, you’ll have free time to explore and glimpse the reconstruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral!

An Evening in Montmartre -  € 45	
Spend an evening in the beautiful Montmartre neighbourhood, affectionately referred to as the ‘last village in Paris’. See the Moulin Rouge, stroll the cobbled streets and visit the charming village shops and romantic terraces. Admire views of the spectacular Sacré-Cœur Basilica before enjoying a three-course dinner filled with authentic French options (vegetarian options are available) finished off with delicious crème brûlée for dessert!

Parisian Cabaret with drinks - € 85	
Experience a fantastic show and the famous French Cancan at one of the top Paris cabaret venues. The shows are lively, colourful and tastefully produced. With striking decor, beautiful costumes and a variety of classic and modern choreography this is a show you will not want to miss! The price includes the show and a glass of French champagne (soft drink option also available).

Jungfraujoch: Journey to the Top of Europe -€ 195
Experience a highlight of European travel when you journey to Jungfraujoch -  the top of Europe! Take the Eiger Express cable car to 3,454m above sea level. Get ready for breathtaking mountain views as you go, the trip is part of the adventure! Arrive at Jungfraujoch which is the highest train station in Europe and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Enjoy the year-round snow, take in the panoramic alpine scenery, marvel at the massive Aletsch Glacier and explore the magical ice palace and Sphinx Observatory! Return by cable car or Jungfraubahn train for even more spectacular mountain vistas. This optional excursion has been voted number one by Expat Explore travellers for several years and comes highly recommended!

Please Note: Certain departures will stay in a different region of the Swiss Alps, with the 'Swiss Alps Mountain Experience' excursion offered in place of Jungfraujoch. 
	
Swiss Fondue Dinner - € 40
What better way to enjoy an evening in Switzerland than with a traditional Swiss fondue dinner? Fondue is a dish popular in Switzerland, France and Italy, with friends and family gathering around a communal table to dip pieces of bread into a pot of melted cheese. Enjoy a taste of Switzerland with this classic fondue dinner.

An Evening in Montecatini - € 45	
Experience a wonderful evening in Montecatini complete with a Tuscan dinner and scenic views! Enjoy a return trip to Montecatini Alto on the Montecatini Funicular and admire the views of Montecatini Terme along the way. Arrive at the restaurant and sit down for a three-course meal. Select your choice of a starter and main and savour the authentic Tuscan flavours! Vegetarian options are available and the tour leader will escort the group throughout the evening. 

Please Note: During winter, the group will travel to Montecatini Alto by taxi as the funicular is closed from October to March.

Taste of Tuscany - € 45	
Tuscany’s food draws millions of visitors to the region every year! Join this incredible culinary experience in Florence to taste it for yourself. Try some special local culinary traditions, served in a sit-down, family-style meal, including Bistecca alla Fiorentina (charcoal-grilled steak served on the bone), Tagliatelle al Tartufo (pasta with truffle), Risotto ai Porcini (risotto with porcini mushrooms), Crostini al Pomodoro (crusty bread with tomatoes and olive oil) and a glass of Chianti red wine. Round off the meal with a traditional Tuscan digestivo.

Rome Conquer the Capital - € 50
Explore Rome and truly “conquer the capital” on this optional excursion! Join your tour leader on a bucket-list ticking treasure hunt challenge around Rome’s city centre and walk in the footsteps of emperors and gladiators! Encounter iconic sites including the Largo di Torre Argentina, Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, Hadrian’s Temple, Marcus Aurelius Square, the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and the Colosseum. You’ll also get to enjoy a delicious lunch at a local restaurant in the city (vegetarian and vegan options are available) and indulge in a gelato tasting!

Regrettably, we can no longer assist with transfers. Therefore we would recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

At Expat Explore we use a bucket pricing system to price and sell our seats. This is similar to that of airlines - to encourage early booking. This means that the very first seats sold on the coach are the cheapest and then the seats increase in price increments as the coach sells out. This means the last seats booked on the coach are more expensive than the first. This also leads to the seat prices being different, depending on the time you booked.

The departure is priced from 2815.00 AUD and due to bucket pricing has increased to 3465.00 AUD.

If there is an uneven number of travellers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveller or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveller.

Thank you for reaching out!

At this stage, your departure is too far in advance for us to give you a confirmed starting hotel. Due to the fact that our hotels are subject to change, we do not provide inaccurate information beforehand to minimize any confusion that may be caused. We therefore suggest reaching out roughly 60 days prior for this information.

What I can share at this point that for this tour, we often use the below Hotel as the Meet Up Location but then again, we can only confirm if there are changes or it will still be the same Hotel around 60 Days before the tour starts.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

We welcome all travellers on our tours but we would like to ensure your comfort and enjoyment, so please ensure that you are happy with the below information and level of fitness required.

Expat Explore tries to be as accommodating as possible, however, our tours are unfortunately not designed for people travelling with mobility issues. Our tours are fast paced because they are designed for you to see the most a destination has to offer. We also want to ensure that you explore as much as possible, which may require long periods without stops on the coach as we drive to new destination.

We offer walking tours in most cities (up to 3 hours), and with mobility issues is not always a practical option as there are often cobbled streets and stairs on these tours.

With regards to our accommodation, not all hotels have lifts and this can potentially mean having to carry bags up and down stairs.

Should you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us again on this chat. 

Kindest regards,
Nicole E

We provide twin-share accommodation on all tours. If you are a solo traveller, you will be placed with another solo traveller of the same gender. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single supplements may be subject to availability. 

If there is an uneven number of travellers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveller or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveller.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

Due to the nature of our tours being packed with activities and extensive walking, we have established a minimum age limit of 10 years old, as they may not be suitable for young children. However, Expat Explore may exercise discretion and potentially consider younger children for specific tours if they fulfill certain criteria. However, it's important to note that 2 years old is considered too young for our tours.

Should you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us again on this chat.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

You will spend each night in a 2-4 star hotel. You can most definitely make use of the showers at the hotel as much as you like while you are there. 

You will spend quite a bit of time on the bus, sometimes up to 7/8 hours however the coach will stop off ever 2 and a half to 3 hours for a rest stop, to stretch your legs, use the restroom and grab a snack. 

We welcome all travellers on our tours but we would like to ensure that you are as comfortable as possible. In light of this, please ensure that you are happy with the below information and level of fitness required.

Expat Explore tries to be as accommodating as possible, however, our tours are unfortunately not designed for people travelling with wheelchairs or severe mobility issues.

Our tours are fast paced because they are designed for you to see the most a destination has to offer. We also want to ensure that you explore as much as possible, which may require long periods without stops on the coach as we drive to a new destination.

We offer walking tours in most cities (up to 3 hours), and a wheelchair is not always a practical option as there are often cobbled streets and stairs on these tours.
You will need a certain level of fitness to join our tours.

If you are ready to book please select the 'book now' button located on the left-hand side to secure your spot on Europe Escape - 12 Days. 

Should you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us again on this chat.

We provide twin-share accommodation on all tours. If you are a solo traveller, you will be placed with another solo traveller of the same gender. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single supplements may be subject to availability. 

If there is an uneven number of travellers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveller or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveller. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets.

PAX would like to know if you can provide pre accommodation and if you can what the costs would be for that, PAX said they are happy to go in one room for 3 people. 

PAX would also like to know if you do assist with transfers from the airport and back to the airport on the last day and if it is not part of the tour package could you please provide what the cost would be for this. 

PAX would also like the hotel names they will be staying at. 

Thank you in advance! 

Kind regards
George

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many hotel partners do not offer triple rooms, and while they may be available in one location, triple rooms are not guaranteed to be available in all destinations. We will request that where there is an uneven number of travellers in your group, you indicate as early as possible which travellers will be sharing a room and who will be placed with another solo traveler of the same gender. Please take note that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking. 
You do have the option of adding a single supplement to your booking at an additional cost.

Regrettably, we are unable to assist with booking pre/post accommodation and transfers however, once you have a confirmed booking we will provide you with links to our affiliates to make the booking process easier. 

Please note that hotel lists can only be shared to confirmed bookings.

If you are ready to book please select the 'book now' button located on the left-hand side to secure your spot on Europe Escape - 12 Days. 

Should you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us again on this chat.

Thank you for your response, 

Kindly note that our standard accommodation is twin share, this means that two travelers will share a room with two twin beds and an ensuite bathroom. The remaining traveler will be roomed with another passenger of the same gender as standard.

Unfortunately, we are no longer able to assist with reserving pre and post-accommodation. Feel free to use Booking.com to make reservations. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the hotels in the area and the prices are competitive.

We recommend using public transport to get from the airport to the hotel and back. If you would like to book a transfer service a great way to do this would be via an online site called Welcome Pickups. If you are unfamiliar with this platform, it is quite straightforward and user-friendly, gives you a great overview of the transfer services in the area and the prices are competitive.

You will receive your tour leader announcement 3-5 days prior to departure with their contact details.

Upon confirmation of your booking, you will receive a link to a form where you can capture all required information, including dietary preferences.

We provide twin-share accommodation on all tours. If you are a solo traveller, you will be placed with another solo traveller of the same gender. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single supplements may be subject to availability. 

If there is an uneven number of travellers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveller or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveller. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets. 

Never been on a coach tour before?

Thank you for your reply!

And first, I want to apologize for any inconveniences that your past trips had caused you. But Tour Radar is abiding that we at Expat Explore are implementing for our tours.

We only have a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee, which means that if you book our tour and cancel within 30 Days after booking, then the refund is refundable. However, if a cancellation is requested after that period, then we can no longer  offer a refund.

Another thing I wanted to share is that since your tour date is more than 76 Days away, instead of cancelling (at the loss of deposit), we can delay the tour date or change it to another tour. We only have 2024 Tour Dates as of now, but we can keep changing it as new dates are offered until you find one that you and Ruth can travel in. Oh, and you can also change your Travel Companion if you like.

Through this option, you will not lose you deposit and not get additional fees. But the cost of the booking will be subject to the current price of the new date or tour.

Hi team,

Tass here from TourRadar reaching out to you on behalf of the travellers.

The travellers mentioned that the price for this adventure yesterday (Nov 8th, 2023) was US$2,145 and it's supposed to be good until today (Nov 9th, 2023). However, the price has now increased to US$2,315, which seems wrong as it is still Nov 9th, 2023 where they're located.

Therefore, could you please honor the price for the travellers at US$2,145 per person?

Thank you in advance for your assistance, we look forward to hearing from you soon!

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

At Expat Explore we use a bucket pricing system to price and sell our seats. This is similar to that of airlines - to encourage early booking. This means that the very first seats sold on the coach are the cheapest and then the seats increase in price increments as the coach sells out. This means the last seats booked on the coach are more expensive than the first. This also leads to the seat prices being different.

At this stage the starting point of this tour is Excel Roma Montemario.

Kindly note that this may be subject to change (although unlikely)

If you are ready to book please select the 'book now' button located on the left-hand side to secure your spot on Europe Escape - 12 Days. 

Should you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us again on this chat. 

Kindest regards,

As you know, there is always some admin and in order to get ours done, we need the following information (as per passport)  from you and all the people who will be joining you in making exciting life-enriching memories.

We provide twin-share accommodation on all tours. If you are a solo traveller, you will be placed with another solo traveller of the same gender. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single supplements may be subject to availability. 

If there is an uneven number of travellers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveller or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveller. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets.

Thank you for confirming, 

The current price for the tour is $3,000.00 AUD per person. The mention of AUD 3925 to AUD 4110 refers to the brochure price or upfront payment. However, due to an automatic travel deal on Tour Radar, a discount of AUD 1110.00 is applied, bringing the total cost back to $3,000.00 AUD per traveler.

I want to assure you that since your booking has been confirmed, the pricing will not increase for you. The previous fluctuations were due to bucket pricing, and travelers who booked before you secured the last seats at the previous bucket price.

Regarding the deposit, it is 10% of the total booking, and it appears there is an outstanding amount of 37.00 AUD for the deposit.

Thanks for your help,

Kind regards

Thank you so much for your replies.

First, I want to acknowledge that we have received and updated the traveler information in our reservations system. However, you would still need to provide additional traveler information through the Important Passenger Information Page. https://expatexplore.com/cs_contact/login?b=58cf0b8f-4d84-4f97-85e8-86950d101e15

For Travel Insurance, I truly cannot provide a clear answer on that inquiry because we do not have that as a product that we sell. We simply recommend for our customers to get one and they would need to check with the provider regarding the flexibility and options offered. We do have one that we highly recommend which is World Nomads and you can their website through the link below and get a quote.

We provide twin-share accommodation on all tours. If you are a solo traveller, you will be placed with another solo traveller of the same gender. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single supplements may be subject to availability. 

If there is an uneven number of travellers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveller or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveller. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets.

Thank you so much for reaching out that we are sad to hear that you won't be able to join us in our Europe Escape Tour in September.

Please note that per our terms and conditions, cancellations will be at the loss of deposit (10%) of the tour cost. Since I am seeing that your deposit is less than the required amount, you might be charged an additional 9.50 GBP to cover the difference.

Another option that I would like to present is to change your Tour Date or the Tour itself and it will not have any fees, but the booking cost will be subject to the current cost of the new tour or tour date but your deposit will be applied to that amount still.

Please let us know if you wish to change your tour or tour date by replying with the new tour and/or date, or if you wish to proceed with the cancellation.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

If there is an uneven number of travellers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveller or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveller outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveller.

Here, you’ll have free time to explore and glimpse the reconstruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral!

An Evening in Montmartre - € 45	
Spend an evening in the beautiful Montmartre neighbourhood, affectionately referred to as the ‘last village in Paris’. See the Moulin Rouge, stroll the cobbled streets and visit the charming village shops and romantic terraces. Admire views of the spectacular Sacré-Cœur Basilica before enjoying a three-course dinner filled with authentic French options (vegetarian options are available) finished off with delicious crème brûlée for dessert!

Enjoy the year-round snow, take in the panoramic alpine scenery, marvel at the massive Aletsch Glacier and explore the magical ice palace and Sphinx Observatory! Return by cable car or Jungfraubahn train for even more spectacular mountain vistas. This optional excursion has been voted number one by Expat Explore travellers for several years and comes highly recommended!

Swiss Fondue Dinner - € 40	
What better way to enjoy an evening in Switzerland than with a traditional Swiss fondue dinner? Fondue is a dish popular in Switzerland, France and Italy, with friends and family gathering around a communal table to dip pieces of bread into a pot of melted cheese. Enjoy a taste of Switzerland with this classic fondue dinner.


An Evening in Montecatini - € 45	
Experience a wonderful evening in Montecatini complete with a Tuscan dinner and scenic views!

Select your choice of a starter and main and savour the authentic Tuscan flavours! Vegetarian options are available and the tour leader will escort the group throughout the evening. 

Please Note: During winter, the group will travel to Montecatini Alto by taxi as the funicular is closed from October to March.

Taste of Tuscany - € 45	
Tuscany’s food draws millions of visitors to the region every year! Join this incredible culinary experience in Florence to taste it for yourself. Try some special local culinary traditions, served in a sit-down, family-style meal, including Bistecca alla Fiorentina (charcoal-grilled steak served on the bone), Tagliatelle al Tartufo (pasta with truffle), Risotto ai Porcini (risotto with porcini mushrooms), Crostini al Pomodoro (crusty bread with tomatoes and olive oil) and a glass of Chianti red wine. Round off the meal with a traditional Tuscan digestivo.

Rome Conquer the Capital - € 50

We provide twin-share accommodation on all tours. If you are a solo traveler, you will be placed with another solo traveler of the same gender. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single supplements may be subject to availability. 

If there is an uneven number of travelers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveler or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveler outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveler. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets.

Unfortunately we do not offer triple rooms. The request for triple rooms is something that comes up frequently. However, it is not something we offer. This is because many hotel partners do not offer triple rooms, and while they may be available in one location, triple rooms are not guaranteed to be available in all destinations. We provide standard twin-share accommodation which means only two travelers per room. 

Do you perhaps have another adult you could bring along for the adventure?

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

Expat Explore believes the best way to get to the heart and soul of a city is on foot, surrounded by the people and the culture. For this reason, we do walking tours through most of the cities we visit.  Many of the cities we visit are vast and old, often with steps and cobblestones. Our walking tours can last up to 3 hours and travelers are required to carry their own bags. Thus, the walking tours do require a moderate level of fitness to enjoy the trip to its fullest.

If you are ready to book please select the 'book now' button located on the left-hand side to secure your spot on Europe Escape - 12 Days. 

Should you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us again on this chat.

We provide twin-share accommodation on all tours. If you are a solo traveler, you will be placed with another solo traveler of the same gender. 
If you would like us to quote you for a private room, please do so via this channel. Please note that single supplements may be subject to availability. 

If there is an uneven number of travelers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveler or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveler outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveler. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets.

If there is an uneven number of travelers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveler or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveler outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveler. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets.

Thank you for your interest in our Europe Escape - 12 Days adventure by Expat Explore Travel.

We are very excited to hear from you!

You've made a great choice by choosing to visit Italy!

The duration of travel and time spent at each destination can vary due to factors such as traffic and other external influences. While we strive to provide an approximate timeframe, kindly note that these are estimates and may change based on real-time conditions.

Time of Travel: 
The duration of travel is subject to traffic conditions and other external factors. We aim to keep travel times reasonable, but they may vary from destination to destination.

Time to See Places: 
We make an effort to allocate approximately an hour at each attraction to allow travelers to explore and enjoy the destination. However, this is dependent on factors like traffic and may be subject to change.

Vegetarian Food:
We accommodate dietary preferences, including vegetarian options. 

Seat Selection for Motion Sickness: 
We understand the concerns regarding motion sickness. While specific seat selection may not be guaranteed, we have a seat rotation policy in place. This policy allows each traveler to experience different views from various angles of the coach during the tour.

If you are ready to book please select the 'book now' button located on the left-hand side to secure your spot on Europe Escape - 12 Days.

If there is an uneven number of travelers on your booking, please advise who will room share with another traveler or whether you would like to purchase a single supplement. Keep in mind that minors under the age of 18 cannot share with another traveler outside of your group's booking.

We are sure you noticed this tour is jam-packed full of great experiences and a lot of these involve walking to get to the heart of little towns and other interesting places. To get the most out of our tours, we will require you to be able to comfortably walk at a moderate pace for at least 2 hours. 

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveler. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets.

Thank you for your updates.

We have gone ahead and noted all the information that you shared regarding each passenger.

Regarding your Inquiries, there are no fixed seat numbers on the Coach because your Tour Leader will be pre-assigning you and will do it in rotation. This means that each traveler will be assigned the same seat all throughout the tour. For any concerns or requests, you may discuss with the Tour Leader once you join the tour on Day 1 but just to give a heads-up, we cannot guarantee that all requests regarding seating can be approved, to ensure that we keep it fair for all travelers.

For Insurance, we are looking for Travel Insurance that at least provides coverage for Trip Cancellations or Disruptions.

We know those who use electric scooters may think that this is no problem but because our coaches are always full of avid adventurers, this means that there is no space to store anything more than one suitcase per traveler. The areas we tour are also not necessarily scooter or wheelchair accessible due to stairs and narrow cobbled streets.

We believe the best way to get to the heart and soul of a city is on foot, surrounded by the people and the culture. For this reason, we do walking tours through most of the cities we visit. Many of the cities you visit are vast and old, often with steps and cobblestones.

We always have plenty of solo travelers joining us on every tour, and they never fail to have a fantastic time. We take pride in our friendly, family-style hosting, making sure everyone feels connected and forms lifelong bonds during our adventures.

We provide twin-share accommodation on all tours and this means that our solo travelers are paired together in a twin room with shared en-suite. While many of our travelers enjoy sharing the experience with a new friend, we understand this isn't for everyone and for that reason we have a single supplement option however this will be at an additional cost. This cost will differ depending on the tour.

Given that this is a group tour, there are often up to 47 other people who may also need to request to sit in front of the coach for many different reasons.

Due to the nature of our tours being packed with activities and extensive walking, we have established a minimum age limit of 10 years old, as they may not be suitable for young children. However, Expat Explore may exercise discretion and potentially consider younger children for specific tours if they fulfill certain criteria. However, it's important to note that 2 years old is considered too young for our tours.

Our cancellation policy is as follows:

If you or any other member of your party decides to cancel your confirmed package you must notify us in writing or via call. If you cancel within 30 days of creating your booking and you are not yet within 45 days of departure, you will be eligible for a full refund. 

If you cancel 45 days or more before departure the cancelation charge will be loss of deposit. 
If you cancel 30 - 44 days before departure the cancelation charge will be 40% of holiday cost
If you cancel 15 - 29 days before departure the cancelation charge will be 70% of holiday cost
If you cancel 14 days or less before departure you will forfeit 100% of holiday cost

Thank you for reaching out to us.

We would recommend budgeting €25-€40 per day (this excludes optional excursions) and this will vary depending on how much you wish to spend on snacks, drinks, souvenirs, optional excursions etc.

The recommended spending money should cover meals (most lunches and some dinners not provided in your itinerary), drinks, snacks, entrance fees, souvenirs and local transport for free days. To help you budget, please see our optional excursions. The amount you will actually spend depends on personal taste and budget but we recommend that you bring along a little more than you think you will need to cover emergencies or unexpected must-have souvenirs.

For the Optional Excursions, we do have a page called the Tour's Help Center Page where it will show the list and the cost of each Optional. However, since this is not yet a Confirmed Booking Inquiry, I cannot send links as it will be redacted by the system.

Once you have booked the tour, I will send you the link to the Help Center Page where it also has a ton of good-to-know information that you might need while preparing for the tour.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

Yours in Travel and Adventure,

Good Morning - I am based in Melbourne Australia - We are looking at family vacation in June 2026 on the 12 day highlights tour starting in Rome. I just wanted to get an idea of a cost for the family of 5 with children (in 2026) being the ages of 16, 14 and 12. We are looking to book this year so we can lock it off and out it in the family plan and budget. Where is your company based? Many thanks Michael lawrence
